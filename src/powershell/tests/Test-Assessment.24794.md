If Terms and Conditions policies are not configured and assigned in Intune, users may access corporate resources without agreeing to required legal, security, or usage terms. This can expose the organization to compliance risks, legal liabilities, and potential misuse of resources. Enforcing Terms and Conditions ensures users acknowledge and accept company policies before accessing sensitive data or systems.
