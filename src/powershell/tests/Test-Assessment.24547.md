If compliance policies are not assigned to Android Enterprise Personally-Owned Work Profile devices in Intune, there is a risk that non-compliant devices could access corporate resources, bypass security controls, and introduce vulnerabilities. Without enforced compliance, devices may lack essential security configurations such as passcode requirements, encryption, or OS version controls, increasing the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access. This weakens the organizationâ€™s security posture and makes it harder to detect and remediate threats.
