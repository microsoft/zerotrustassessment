When sign-ins are not restricted to managed devices, threat actors can use unmanaged devices to establish initial access to organizational resources. Unmanaged devices lack organizational security controls, endpoint protection, and compliance verification, creating entry points for threat actors to exploit. Unmanaged devices lack centralized security controls, compliance monitoring, and policy enforcement, creating gaps in the organization's security perimeter. Threat actors can compromise these devices through malware, keyloggers, or credential harvesting tools, then use the captured credentials to authenticate corporate resources without detection. Accounts that are assigned administrative rights are a target for attackers. Requiring users with these highly privileged rights to perform actions from devices marked as compliant or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined can help limit possible exposure. Without device compliance requirements, threat actors can maintain persistence through uncontrolled endpoints, bypass security monitoring that would typically detect anomalous behavior on managed devices and use unmanaged devices as staging areas for lateral movement across network resources.
