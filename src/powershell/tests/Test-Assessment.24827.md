If Conditional Access policies are not combined with App Protection controls, users may connect to corporate resources through unmanaged or unsecured applications. This creates significant risk of data leakage, unauthorized access, and regulatory non-compliance. By enforcing App Protection policies within Conditional Access, only trusted and compliant applications are permitted to handle corporate data. These policies apply safeguards such as encryption, data loss prevention, and access restrictions, ensuring sensitive information remains protected. Without this layered control, threat actors could exploit unprotected apps to bypass security measures and compromise organizational data.
