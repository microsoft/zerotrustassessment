Enabling automatic Microsoft Defender enrollment for Android devices through Microsoft Intune ensures that all managed Android devices are protected by advanced threat defense capabilities. This configuration helps safeguard corporate data and resources from mobile threats by enforcing security policies and automating the onboarding process. If Defender enrollment is not enabled, Android devices may be left unprotected, increasing the risk of malware, phishing, and other mobile threats.
