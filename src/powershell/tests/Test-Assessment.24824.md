If Conditional Access policies do not enforce device compliance, users may connect to corporate resources from devices that do not meet security standards. This exposes sensitive data to risks such as malware, unauthorized access, and regulatory non-compliance. By requiring device compliance in Conditional Access policies, only trusted and compliant devices are permitted to access corporate data. These policies ensure safeguards like encryption, device health checks, and access restrictions are applied, protecting organizational information from compromise. Without this control, threat actors could exploit non-compliant devices to bypass security measures.
