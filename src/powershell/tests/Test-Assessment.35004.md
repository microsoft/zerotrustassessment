Creating sensitivity labels is the first step in information protection deployment. Labels must be published through label policies before users can apply them to content. Label policies define which users or groups receive which labels, determine default labeling behavior, and enforce mandatory labeling requirements.

**Remediation action**

To create and publish a label policy:
1. Navigate to Microsoft Purview portal → Information protection → Label policies
2. Select "Publish labels"
3. Choose sensitivity labels to include in the policy
4. Assign the policy to users, groups, or all users
5. Configure policy settings (mandatory labeling, default label, justification requirements)
6. Review and publish the policy
