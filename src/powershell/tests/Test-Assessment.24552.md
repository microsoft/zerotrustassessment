Without a centrally managed firewall policy, macOS devices are left with their default or user-modified firewall settings, which may be inconsistent or inadequate for corporate security standards. This creates an immediate risk, as an improperly configured firewall can allow unsolicited inbound connections, making the device visible to threat actors scanning the network for vulnerable targets. Should a threat actor successfully exploit another vulnerability to gain initial access, a weak firewall configuration facilitates the next stages of an attack. It allows malicious software to establish outbound connections to command-and-control (C2) servers for instructions and data exfiltration. Furthermore, it fails to prevent lateral movement, where the compromised device is used as a staging point to attack other systems within the corporate network, significantly escalating the scope and impact of the breach.

**Remediation action**

Create and apply a firewall policy for macOS devices to protect them from network threats:
