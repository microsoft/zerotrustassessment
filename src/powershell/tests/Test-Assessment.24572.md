Without a configured and assigned device enrollment notification in Intune, threat actors can exploit device onboarding gaps to enroll unauthorized or unmanaged devices, bypassing organizational compliance and visibility. This can lead to threat actors gaining access to corporate resources, increasing the risk of data leakage, lateral movement, and persistence within the environment. Also, if notifications are not assigned, users may not be informed of enrollment requirements or security expectations, weakening the organizationâ€™s security posture and making it easier for threat actors to exploit device enrollment vulnerabilities. This exposure can result in regulatory non-compliance and operational disruption.
