The activity logs and reports in Microsoft Entra can help detect unauthorized access attempts or identify when tenant configuration changes. When logs are archived or integrated with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, security teams can implement powerful monitoring and detection security controls, proactive threat hunting, and incident response processes. The logs and monitoring features can be used to assess tenant health and provide evidence for compliance and audits.

If logs aren't regularly archived or sent to a SIEM tool for querying, it's challenging to investigate sign-in issues. The absence of historical logs means that security teams might miss patterns of failed sign-in attempts, unusual activity, and other indicators of compromise. This lack of visibility can prevent the timely detection of breaches, allowing attackers to maintain undetected access for extended periods.
