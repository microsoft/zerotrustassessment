Web Content Filtering in Microsoft Entra Internet Access helps organizations control access to websites based on web categories, domains or URL, reducing exposure to malicious or inappropriate content. When traffic is routed through Microsoft Entra Internet Access, filtering policies can block or allow entire categories like Gambling or Social Media, or specific domains/URL, ensuring safer browsing across all devices and locations. 

Configuring these policies is critical for security and compliance. It prevents phishing and malware risks, enforces corporate standards, and improves productivity by restricting non-business sites.
