Without extended retention for Global Secure Access audit and traffic logs, threat actors can operate beyond the default 30-day retention window knowing their activities will be automatically purged, eliminating security evidence before detection occurs. When security teams detect suspicious patterns or receive breach notifications from external sources, investigations often require historical analysis spanning weeks or months to identify initial compromise vectors, lateral movement patterns, and data exfiltration channels. The default 30-day retention period in Microsoft Entra proves insufficient for most enterprise investigations, particularly when threat actors employ low-and-slow techniques or maintain persistent access over extended periods. Organizations subject to regulatory frameworks including GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOX face compliance violations when unable to produce audit trails for mandated retention periods, typically ranging from 90 days to multiple years. Without accessible historical logs, security operations teams cannot establish baseline behavior patterns for users and devices, perform retrospective threat hunting when new indicators of compromise emerge, or correlate network access events with identity signals and endpoint telemetry across extended timeframes. Inadequate retention eliminates the organization's ability to conduct thorough root cause analysis during incident response, potentially allowing threat actors to maintain undetected persistence mechanisms while organizations focus only on visible symptoms rather than underlying compromise patterns.

**Remediation action**
- Configure diagnostic settings with Log Analytics workspace for extended retention (90-730 days) with query capabilities.
    - [Integrate Microsoft Entra logs with Azure Monitor logs](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/DiagnosticSettings) 
- Configure Log Analytics workspace retention to meet organizational security and compliance requirements (minimum 90 days recommended)
