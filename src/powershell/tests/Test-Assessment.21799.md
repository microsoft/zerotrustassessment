When high-risk sign-ins are not properly restricted through Conditional Access policies, organizations expose themselves to security vulnerabilities. Threat actors can exploit these gaps for initial access through compromised credentials, credential stuffing attacks, or anomalous sign-in patterns that Microsoft Entra ID Protection identifies as risky behaviors. Without appropriate restrictions, threat actors who successfully authenticate during high-risk scenarios can perform privilege escalation by misusing the authenticated session to access sensitive resources, modify security configurations, or conduct reconnaissance activities within the environment. Once threat actors establish access through uncontrolled high-risk sign-ins, they can achieve persistence by creating additional accounts, installing backdoors, or modifying authentication policies to maintain long-term access to the organization's resources. The unrestricted access enables threat actors to conduct lateral movement across systems and applications using the authenticated session, potentially accessing sensitive data stores, administrative interfaces, or critical business applications. Finally, threat actors achieve impact through data exfiltration, or compromise business-critical systems while maintaining plausible deniability by exploiting the fact that their risky authentication was not properly challenged or blocked.
