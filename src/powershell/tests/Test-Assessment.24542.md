If a compliance policy for macOS is not configured in Intune, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or non-compliant macOS devices to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist within the environment. Without enforced compliance, macOS devices may lack critical security configurations such as encryption, password requirements, or OS version controls, increasing the risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This gap in device compliance management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate threats or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.
