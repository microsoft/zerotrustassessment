If an App protection policy (APP) for Android is not configured in Intune, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or insufficiently protected mobile applications to exfiltrate corporate data, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment. Without APP, sensitive data accessed via corporate apps on Android devices is vulnerable to data leakage through copy/paste, backup, or unencrypted storage. Threat actors may use compromised or non-compliant devices to bypass controls, move laterally, or introduce malicious payloads, undermining the organizationâ€™s data protection and compliance posture. This gap in mobile application management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate data loss or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.
