Organizations that fail to enable custom banned password lists expose themselves to a systematic attack chain where threat actors exploit predictable organizational password patterns. When custom banned passwords are not configured, threat actors can leverage publicly available information about the organization—such as company names, product names, locations, and industry-specific terminology—to construct targeted password dictionaries for credential-based attacks. These threat actors typically begin with reconnaissance phases where they gather organizational intelligence from websites, social media, and public records to identify likely password components. Armed with this knowledge, they launch password spray attacks that test organization-specific password variations across multiple user accounts, staying below lockout thresholds to avoid detection. The absence of custom banned password protection means that even when organizations educate users about password security, employees often still incorporate familiar organizational terms into their passwords, creating consistent attack vectors. This vulnerability becomes particularly severe when threat actors combine organizational terms with common password patterns, as the global banned password list alone cannot anticipate every organization's specific terminology, leaving critical gaps in password protection that enable successful initial access and subsequent lateral movement within the enterprise environment.
