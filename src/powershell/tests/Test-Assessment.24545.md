If compliance policies are not assigned to Fully managed Android Enterprise devices in Intune, threat actors can exploit non-compliant devices to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist in the environment.  
Without enforced compliance, devices may lack critical security configurations such as passcode requirements, encryption, or OS version controls, increasing the risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This gap in device compliance management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate threats or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.
