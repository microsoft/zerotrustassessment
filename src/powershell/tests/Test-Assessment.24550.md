Without a properly configured and assigned Local Users and Groups policy in Intune, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or misconfigured local accounts on Windows devices. This can lead to unauthorized privilege escalation, persistence, and lateral movement within the environment. Without a properly configured and assigned BitLocker policy in Intune, threat actors can exploit unencrypted Windows devices to gain unauthorized access to sensitive corporate data. Devices lacking enforced encryption are vulnerable to physical attacks, such as disk removal or booting from external media, allowing attackers to bypass operating system security controls. This can result in data exfiltration, credential theft, and further lateral movement within the environment. Ensuring BitLocker is enforced across all managed Windows devices is critical for compliance with data protection regulations and for reducing the risk of data breaches.
