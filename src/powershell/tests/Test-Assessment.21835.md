Microsoft recommends that organizations have two cloud-only emergency access accounts permanently assigned the [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?wt.mc_id=zerotrustrecommendations_automation_content_cnl_csasci#global-administrator) role. These accounts are highly privileged and aren't assigned to specific individuals. The accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass" scenarios where normal accounts can't be used or all other administrators are accidentally locked out.

**Remediation action**

- Create accounts following the [emergency access account recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access?wt.mc_id=zerotrustrecommendations_automation_content_cnl_csasci).
