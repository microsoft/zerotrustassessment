If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, macOS devices can fail to connect to secure networks or connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access. Without centralized management, devices rely on manual configuration, increasing the risk of misconfiguration, weak authentication, and connection to rogue networks. These gaps can lead to data interception, unauthorized network access, and compliance violations.

Centrally managing Wi-Fi profiles for macOS devices in Intune ensures secure and consistent connectivity to enterprise networks. This enforces authentication and encryption standards, simplifies onboarding, and supports Zero Trust by reducing exposure to untrusted networks.

**Remediation action**

Use Intune to configure and assign secure Wi-Fi profiles for macOS devices to enforce authentication and encryption standards:
