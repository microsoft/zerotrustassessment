If macOS update policies are not created and assigned, threat actors can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in macOS devices within the organization. Without enforced update policies, devices may remain on outdated software versions, increasing the attack surface for privilege escalation, remote code execution, or persistence techniques. Threat actors can leverage these weaknesses to gain initial access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the environment.  
The absence of assignment means that even if a policy exists, it is not applied to any device group, leaving endpoints unprotected and compliance gaps undetected. This can result in widespread compromise, data exfiltration, and operational disruption.
