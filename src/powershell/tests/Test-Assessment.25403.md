Without the Microsoft Entra Private Access Sensor agent deployed to domain controllers, threat actors can exploit Kerberos authentication requests from any device on the network. This includes unmanaged or compromised endpoints that can obtain service tickets for on-premises resources without multifactor authentication or device compliance validation. Once initial access is established through weak authentication to domain controllers, threat actors can request Kerberos tickets for privileged resources such as file shares, database servers, and remote desktop services. This enables lateral movement across the on-premises environment. The absence of identity-centric access controls on domain controllers allows threat actors to bypass conditional access policies. Kerberos authentication traditionally operates within a perimeter-based trust model where any authenticated user can request tickets regardless of authentication strength or device posture. This creates opportunities for threat actors to maintain persistence by continuously requesting service tickets from compromised or unmanaged devices, escalating privileges by targeting Service Principal Names associated with sensitive systems, and exfiltrating data from resources that rely solely on Kerberos authentication without additional security layers. The gap becomes particularly problematic when threat actors compromise user credentials through phishing or credential theft, as they can immediately leverage those credentials to access domain-authenticated resources. This can occur without triggering conditional access policies or multifactor authentication requirements that would normally apply to cloud-based access scenarios.
