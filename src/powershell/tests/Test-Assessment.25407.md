Internet Access policies can be assigned in two ways: through the Baseline Profile or via Conditional Access policies using Security Profiles. The Baseline Profile establishes a default set of policies that apply automatically to all users. In contrast, Security Profiles enable targeted assignments by linking specific Internet Access policies to users or groups through Conditional Access.

This check verifies that security profiles are assigned to users through one or more conditional access policies. This check will fail if a conditional access policy assigning a security profile cannot be found.
