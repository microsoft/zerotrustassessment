If Endpoint analytics is not enabled, threat actors can exploit blind spots in device health, performance, and security posture. Without this visibility, organizations are unable to detect anomalous device behavior, delayed patching, or configuration drift, which can be leveraged by threat actors to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally across the environment. The absence of analytics data impedes rapid detection and response, allowing attackers to exploit unmonitored endpoints for command and control, data exfiltration, or further compromise. This lack of insight breaks the chain of defense, making it difficult to identify and remediate issues before they are weaponized.
