Without properly configured and assigned security baselines in Intune, Windows devices remain vulnerable to a wide array of attack vectors that threat actors can exploit to establish persistence and escalate privileges. Threat actors can leverage default Windows configurations that lack hardened security settings to perform lateral movement through techniques such as credential dumping, privilege escalation through unpatched vulnerabilities, and exploitation of weak authentication mechanisms. The absence of security baselines enables threat actors to bypass security controls, maintain persistence through registry modifications, and exfiltrate sensitive data through unmonitored channels. Additionally, devices without security baselines fail to implement defense-in-depth strategies, allowing threat actors to progress through the kill chain more easily from initial access to data exfiltration, ultimately compromising organizational security posture and potentially violating compliance requirements.
