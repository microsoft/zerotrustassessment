Without enforced SSO policies, macOS endpoints may rely on insecure or inconsistent authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to bypass conditional access and compliance policies. This opens the door to lateral movement across cloud services and on-premises resources, especially when federated identities are used. Threat actors can persist by leveraging stolen tokens or cached credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data through unmanaged apps or browser sessions. The absence of SSO enforcement also undermines app protection policies and device posture assessments, making it difficult to detect and contain breaches. Ultimately, failure to configure and assign macOS SSO policies compromises identity security and weakens the organization's zero trust posture.
