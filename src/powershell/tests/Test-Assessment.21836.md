If administrators assign privileged roles to workload identities, such as service principals or managed identities, the tenant can be exposed to significant risk if those identities are compromised. Threat actors who gain access to a privileged workload identity can perform reconnaissance to enumerate resources, escalate privileges, and manipulate or exfiltrate sensitive data. The attack chain typically begins with credential theft or abuse of a vulnerable application. Next step is privilege escalation through the assigned role, lateral movement across cloud resources, and finally persistence via other role assignments or credential updates. Workload identities are often used in automation and might not be monitored as closely as user accounts. Compromise can then go undetected, allowing threat actors to maintain access and control over critical resources. Workload identities aren't subject to user-centric protections like MFA, making least-privilege assignment and regular review essential.
