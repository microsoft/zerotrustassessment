If Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) is not configured and assigned to all users and devices, threat actors can exploit weak authentication mechanisms—such as passwords—to gain unauthorized access. This can lead to credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the environment. Without strong, policy-driven authentication like WHfB, attackers can compromise devices and accounts, increasing the risk of widespread impact. Enforcing WHfB disrupts this attack chain by requiring strong, multi-factor authentication, reducing the risk of credential-based attacks and unauthorized access.
