When default outbound B2B collaboration settings allow all users to access all applications in any external Microsoft Entra organization, organizations lose control over where corporate data flows and who employees collaborate with. Users may intentionally or accidentally upload sensitive data to external tenants, accept invitations from spoofed or malicious tenants designed for phishing, or grant OAuth consent to risky applications that compromise corporate data. External tenants operate outside the organization's security perimeter, meaning Conditional Access policies, Data Loss Prevention, and sensitivity labels cannot be enforced, and user activity cannot be audited. For regulated industries, unrestricted external collaboration may violate data residency requirements or prohibitions on sharing data with unapproved organizations. Additionally, users may unintentionally affiliate with customers', vendors', or competitors' tenants, creating brand confusion and support burden when external tenant issues are escalated to internal IT. By blocking default outbound B2B collaboration, organizations enforce a deny-by-default posture that restricts external relationships to vetted partners, protects intellectual property, and ensures visibility over every cross-tenant collaboration. This should be aligned to your organization's tenant restrictions policy.
