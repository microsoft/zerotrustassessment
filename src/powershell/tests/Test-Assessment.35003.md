Sensitivity labels are the foundation of Microsoft Information Protection, enabling organizations to classify and protect sensitive data across Microsoft 365 services, on-premises locations, and third-party applications. Without sensitivity labels configured, organizations have no standardized way to identify, classify, or protect sensitive information, leaving confidential data vulnerable to unauthorized access, sharing, or exfiltration. Conversely, too many labels presented to the end user overwhelm and reduce effectiveness.

**Remediation action**

To create sensitivity labels:
1. Navigate to [Microsoft Purview compliance portal > Information Protection > Labels](https://compliance.microsoft.com/informationprotection/labels)
2. Select "Create a label"
3. Configure label settings including:
   - Name and description
   - Scope (Files & emails, Meetings, Schematized data assets, etc.)
   - Protection settings (encryption, content marking, auto-labeling)
4. Save the label
5. Publish the label via a label policy to make it available to users
