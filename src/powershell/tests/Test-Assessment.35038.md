Insider Risk Management (IRM) policies with Adaptive Protection enable organizations to detect and prevent risky behavior involving sensitive data, including unauthorized sharing with external parties, mass downloads, unusual data access patterns, and data exfiltration attempts. Without IRM policies configured and enabled with Adaptive Protection integration (`OptInDrpForDlp`), organizations cannot identify insider threats or malicious actors who abuse legitimate access to exfiltrate data. IRM policies that integrate with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) create a comprehensive detection system that combines behavioral indicators (unusual access patterns) with policy-based content detection (sensitive data types), enabling rapid response to insider threats before data is compromised. Organizations must enable at least one IRM policy with Adaptive Protection enabled to detect and mitigate insider risk, including risky AI usage scenarios where users attempt to expose sensitive data to large language models or unauthorized cloud AI services. Without IRM policies, organizations cannot meet insider threat management requirements or demonstrate proactive threat detection capabilities to regulators.

**Remediation action**

To create and enable Insider Risk Management policies with Adaptive Protection:

1. Sign in as a Global Administrator or Compliance Administrator to the [Microsoft Purview portal](https://purview.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to Insider Risk Management > Policies
3. Select "+ Create policy" to start the policy creation workflow
4. Choose a policy template (Data leaks, Security policy violations, Risky browser usage, etc.)
5. Name the policy and configure the scope (all users or specific groups)
6. Configure triggering events and risk indicators for the policy
7. Enable Adaptive Protection integration: 
   - In policy settings, enable "Adaptive Protection" (OptInDrpForDlp)
   - Assign a DLP policy to use for Adaptive Protection
   - This allows the policy to combine behavioral risk indicators with DLP detection
8. Review and activate the policy
9. Monitor alerts generated by the policy

Via PowerShell (limited; most configuration requires portal):
- Connect-IPPSSession
- Get-InsiderRiskPolicy | Select-Object Name, Enabled, OptInDrpForDlp
