Centrally managing corporate Wi-Fi network for iOS devices through Microsoft Intune ensures that all corporate devices connect securely and consistently to enterprise wireless networks. This approach enforces security standards (such as WPA/WPA2 Enterprise), simplifies onboarding, and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized access. If Wi-Fi profiles are not properly configured and assigned, users may be unable to connect to secure networks, or may connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access.
