A threat actor or a well-intentioned but uninformed employee can create a new Microsoft Entra tenant if there are no restrictions in place. By default, the user who creates a tenant is automatically assigned the Global Administrator role. Without proper controls, this action fractures the identity perimeter by creating a tenant outside the organization's governance and visibility. It introduces risk though a shadow identity platform that can be exploited for token issuance, brand impersonation, consent phishing, or persistent staging infrastructure. Since the rogue tenant might not be tethered to the enterpriseâ€™s administrative or monitoring planes, traditional defenses are blind to its creation, activity, and potential misuse.

**Remediation action**

Enable the **Restrict non-admin users from creating tenants** setting. For users that need the ability to create tenants, assign them the Tenant Creator role. You can also review tenant creation events in the Microsoft Entra audit logs.
