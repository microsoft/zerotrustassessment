When Quick Access in Entra Private Access is configured without Conditional Access policies, threat actors who compromise user credentials gain unrestricted access to private resources. The Quick Access application creates an enterprise application that serves as a container for private resources including FQDNs and IP addresses, and without policy enforcement, compromised accounts provide a pathway to internal systems. Threat actors who obtain credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or password spray attacks can authenticate to the Quick Access application and tunnel directly to private corporate resources without additional verification requirements. Once authenticated, threat actors establish persistence by maintaining sessions to private applications and resources, enabling lateral movement across the internal network to access additional systems and sensitive data. Without Conditional Access enforcement requiring controls like device compliance or location verification, threat actors operating from unmanaged devices or anomalous locations can access private resources indistinguishable from authorized users. The absence of multi-factor authentication requirements or device health checks eliminates defense-in-depth controls, allowing threat actors to exfiltrate data from private applications or deploy malware to internal systems through the tunneled connection.
