Compliance policy allows IT Admins and End-users to identify missing settings, apps, and updates to keep their devices current and proactively remediate vulnerabilities. The non-compliant state of a device can also be used as a signal for conditional access, ensuring that end users must remediate their devices before gaining access to corporate resources if they fail to act in time.

If a compliance policy for Windows is not configured as assigned in Intune, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or non-compliant Windows devices to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist within the environment. Without enforced compliance, Windows devices may lack critical security configurations such as BitLocker encryption, password requirements, firewall settings, or OS version controls, increasing the risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This gap in device compliance management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate threats or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.
