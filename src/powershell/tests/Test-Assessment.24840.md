Centrally managing corporate Wi-Fi network settings for fully managed Android Enterprise devices through Microsoft Intune ensures that all corporate devices connect securely and consistently to enterprise wireless networks. This approach enforces security standards (such as WPA Enterprise), simplifies onboarding, and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized access. If Wi-Fi profiles are not properly configured and assigned, users may be unable to connect to secure networks, or may connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access.
