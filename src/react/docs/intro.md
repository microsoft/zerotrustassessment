# Introduction

Implementing a Zero Trust strategy can pose many challenges, such as knowing where to start, what order to implement things in, and how to accurately measure success towards achieving a secure Zero Trust posture. The Microsoft Zero Trust Workshop aims to tackle these problems and simplify the Zero Trust journey via two tools: the Zero Trust Workshop and the Zero Trust Assessment.

## Microsoft Zero Trust Workshop
The Zero Trust Workshop Tool is a manual tool (in the form of an Excel file) that enables customers to log their current Zero Trust progress and develop an actionable roadmap for moving forward. The Zero Trust Workshop Tool currently supports the following pillars:
- Identity (Recently Updated)
- Devices (Recently Upated)
- Data (Recently Updated)
- Network (New)
- Infrastructure (New)
- Security Operations (New)

For more information, check out the [Introduction to the Zero Trust Workshop](./videos/IntroductionToZT.md) page.

## Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment
The Zero Trust Assessment is a PowerShell module that can be run on your environment to confirm a strong security baseline. This is an automated tool, where running the PowerShell module on your tenant will provide you with a set of recommendations that are auto generated based on your tenant's current configuration and activity data.
