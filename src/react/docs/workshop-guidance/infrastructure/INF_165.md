# Review & Remediate Key Vault Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Reviewing and remediating recommendations requires collaboration between security and platform teams, and may involve changes to access policies, logging, and configuration settings.

**User Impact:** Low — These changes are made at the infrastructure level and do not require end-user interaction or notification.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Key Vault continuously evaluates your Azure Key Vault configurations and usage patterns to identify security risks. It generates actionable recommendations to help you harden your Key Vault instances and reduce the attack surface.

Common recommendations include:

- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures granular control over who can access and manage secrets, keys, and certificates [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-keyvault).
- **Enable logging and diagnostics**: Helps detect and investigate suspicious access attempts.
- **Restrict public network access**: Prevents unauthorized access from the internet.
- **Use private endpoints**: Ensures secure, private connectivity to Key Vault resources.

To review and remediate these recommendations:

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal.
2. Select **Recommendations** from the left-hand menu.
3. Filter by **Key Vault**.
4. Review each recommendation’s severity, description, and remediation guidance.
5. Apply the recommended changes manually or through automation tools like Azure Policy or ARM templates [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-keyvault).

These actions support the **"Use Least Privilege Access"** and **"Assume Breach"** principles of Zero Trust by minimizing unnecessary access and continuously monitoring for threats. Ignoring these recommendations can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive secrets and keys, increasing the risk of data breaches or service compromise.
