# Prerequisites Check

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must validate cloud subscriptions, enable Defender for Cloud, and connect multicloud environments before enabling Defender for Databases.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Before enabling Microsoft Defender for Databases, organizations must complete several prerequisites to ensure a successful and secure deployment. These steps are essential for activating the database protection plans across Azure, AWS, and GCP environments.

### Key Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription**  
   - You must have an active Microsoft Azure subscription. If not, sign up for a free subscription.

2. **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud**  
   - Defender for Databases is a feature within Microsoft Defender for Cloud. You must enable Defender for Cloud on your Azure subscription.

3. **Connect Multicloud Environments**  
   - If you plan to protect databases hosted on AWS or GCP, you must connect those accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

4. **Enable the Databases Plan**  
   - Once prerequisites are met, you can enable the Databases plan, which activates the following modules:
     - Defender for Azure SQL Databases  
     - Defender for SQL Servers on Machines  
     - Defender for Open-Source Relational Databases  
     - Defender for Azure Cosmos DB

These steps align with the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"**, ensuring that all environments and workloads are authenticated and authorized before protection is applied. Skipping these prerequisites may result in incomplete coverage, leaving critical workloads unmonitored and vulnerable to threats.
