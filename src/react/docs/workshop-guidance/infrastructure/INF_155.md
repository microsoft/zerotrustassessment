# Determine Response Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Defining a response strategy involves integrating Defender for APIs with SIEM/SOAR tools, setting up alert rules, and coordinating with incident response teams.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are handled by security operations and platform teams; no direct user involvement is required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for APIs provides runtime threat detection and integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to support a full incident response lifecycle. A well-defined response strategy ensures that API-related threats are detected, triaged, and remediated efficiently using existing security operations workflows.

### Key Elements of a Response Strategy

- **Alerting**: Defender for APIs generates alerts for threats such as unauthenticated access, sensitive data exposure, and OWASP API Top 10 risks [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).
- **SIEM Integration**: Alerts can be forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel or other SIEM platforms for centralized monitoring and correlation [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).
- **Incident Management**: Use the Microsoft Defender portal to classify, assign, and track incidents. This includes tagging, severity scoring, and linking related alerts [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).
- **Automation**: Integrate with SOAR tools or Power Automate to trigger playbooks for containment, notification, or remediation.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct root cause analysis and update detection rules or posture configurations to prevent recurrence [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

Without a defined response strategy, API threats may go undetected or unresolved, increasing the risk of data breaches or service disruption. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by ensuring rapid detection and coordinated response to API threats.
