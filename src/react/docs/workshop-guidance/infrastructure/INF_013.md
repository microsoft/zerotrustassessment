# Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Establishing feedback loops requires coordination between security operations, engineering, and compliance teams to review findings and adjust configurations or processes.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend process improvement activity; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Feedback loops in Microsoft Defender for Cloud are essential for driving **continuous improvement** in cloud security posture. These loops involve regularly reviewing security recommendations, alerts, governance reports, and secure score trends to identify patterns, gaps, and opportunities for optimization. Insights gained from these reviews can be used to refine policies, update governance rules, adjust role assignments, and improve automation workflows.

Key components of effective feedback loops include:

- **Secure Score tracking** to monitor posture over time.
- **Governance reports** to assess remediation performance.
- **Alert analytics** to identify recurring threats or misconfigurations.
- **Workflow automation reviews** to ensure timely and effective responses.

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that security operations are not static but evolve based on real-world data and threat intelligence. It also aligns with observability practices that help benchmark performance and drive platform enhancements [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/observability-continuous-improvement/).
