# Manage Alert Suppression Rules

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Creating and managing suppression rules requires understanding alert types, configuring rule logic, and ensuring that critical alerts are not unintentionally hidden.

**User Impact:** Low — Suppression rules are managed by security teams and do not affect end-user experience or application behavior.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud allows security teams to manage alert noise by creating **alert suppression rules**. These rules help reduce alert fatigue by hiding known, non-actionable alerts while maintaining visibility into critical threats. Suppression can be applied across services like App Service, Key Vault, and Resource Manager.

### Use Cases for Suppression

- Suppress alerts from known safe tools or processes.
- Reduce duplicate alerts from recurring, low-risk events.
- Focus analyst attention on high-severity or novel threats.

### How to Manage Suppression Rules

1. **Access Suppression Settings**:
   - Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) with Security Administrator or Global Administrator privileges [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/manage-suppression-rules).

2. **Navigate to Suppression Rules**:
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Settings** > **Alerts** > **Suppression rules** [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules).

3. **Create a Suppression Rule**:
   - Choose an existing alert to suppress or define a new rule.
   - Specify conditions such as alert title, severity, affected resource types, or specific entities (e.g., IPs, users).
   - Define the scope (e.g., subscription, resource group) and action (suppress or resolve).

4. **Manage Existing Rules**:
   - View, edit, or delete suppression rules from the same interface.
   - Optionally release previously suppressed alerts if rule conditions change [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/manage-suppression-rules).

5. **API Support**:
   - Suppression rules can also be managed programmatically using the [Defender for Cloud REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules).

### Best Practices

- Regularly review suppression rules to ensure they are still valid.
- Avoid suppressing high-severity alerts unless they are fully understood and documented.
- Use suppression sparingly to maintain visibility into evolving threats.

This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by helping teams focus on meaningful alerts while maintaining a secure and monitored environment.
