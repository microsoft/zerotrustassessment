# Plan a Lifecycle Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Planning a lifecycle strategy requires collaboration between API owners, security teams, and platform administrators to define onboarding, monitoring, and decommissioning processes.

**User Impact:** Low  
This planning activity is handled by administrators and security teams; no direct user involvement is required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for APIs provides full lifecycle protection for APIsâ€”from onboarding and classification to threat detection and decommissioning. A lifecycle strategy ensures that APIs are continuously monitored, evaluated for risk, and retired securely when no longer in use.

Key components of a lifecycle strategy include:

- **Onboarding**: Ensure APIs are published in Azure API Management and onboarded into Defender for APIs.
- **Visibility & Inventory**: Use the API Security dashboard in Defender for Cloud to maintain an up-to-date inventory of all managed APIs.
- **Security Posture Management**: Regularly review security findings and apply recommendations to harden APIs.
- **Data Sensitivity Classification**: Classify APIs based on the sensitivity of the data they handle to prioritize protection.
- **Threat Detection & Response**: Monitor API traffic for anomalies and integrate with SIEM tools for incident response.
- **Decommissioning**: Identify inactive or unused APIs (e.g., no traffic in 30 days) and retire them securely to reduce attack surface.

Without a defined lifecycle strategy, APIs may remain exposed after they are no longer in use, or lack consistent monitoring and classification. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by ensuring continuous visibility and control over the entire API lifecycle.
