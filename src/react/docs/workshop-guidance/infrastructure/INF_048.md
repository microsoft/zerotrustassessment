# Review & Remediate Security Risk Concerns via Cloud Security Explorer

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must build and run graph-based queries, analyze contextual risk data, and take remediation actions across cloud and hybrid workloads.

**User Impact:** Low  
Security risk analysis and remediation are handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

The **Cloud Security Explorer** in Microsoft Defender for Servers enables security teams to proactively identify and remediate security risks by querying the **cloud security graph**. This graph includes contextual data such as misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and lateral movement paths across Azure, AWS, and GCP environments.

### Key Capabilities

- Run **graph-based queries** to detect:
  - Exposed secrets
  - Misconfigured resources
  - Vulnerable machines
  - Attack paths and lateral movement risks
- Prioritize risks based on **resource criticality**, **exposure**, and **blast radius**
- Drill into findings and take **remediation actions** directly from the interface [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-cloud-deployment-secrets) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-attack-path) [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer)

## How to Use Cloud Security Explorer

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Cloud Security Explorer**.
3. Build a query:
   - Select a **resource type** (e.g., Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts).
   - Choose a **risk category** (e.g., secrets, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities).
   - Apply filters such as **environment**, **region**, or **exposure level** [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer).
4. Review the query results:
   - Each result includes metadata such as resource name, severity, and attack path presence.
   - Click on a result to view detailed findings.

## How to Remediate

- From the query results, select a resource with a risk finding.
- Click **Remediate** or follow the linked **recommendation**.
- For secrets:
  - Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Inventory > VM > Secrets tab**.
  - Review and remove or rotate exposed secrets [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-cloud-deployment-secrets).
- For misconfigurations or vulnerabilities:
  - Follow the remediation steps provided in the recommendation pane.

## Additional Tools

- **Attack Path View**: Visualize how a risk could be exploited to reach critical assets.
- **Security Exposure Management**: Centralized dashboard for prioritizing and tracking remediation efforts.

Failing to use Cloud Security Explorer can result in missed opportunities to detect and mitigate high-risk exposures. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by enabling proactive, data-driven risk management.
