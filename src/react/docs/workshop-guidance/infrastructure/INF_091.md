# Plan for Incident Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Planning an incident response strategy requires collaboration between security operations, DevOps, and platform teams to define workflows, configure integrations, and align with organizational response policies.

**User Impact:** Low  
This is a backend security operations task; end users are not directly involved or impacted.

## Overview

Planning for incident response in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** ensures that security teams are prepared to detect, investigate, and respond to container-based threats across Kubernetes environments such as AKS, EKS, and GKE. Defender integrates with the **Microsoft Defender portal**, enabling real-time alerting, automated response actions, and threat investigation tools.

Key components of an incident response plan include:

- **Alerting and Detection**: Defender for Containers generates alerts for suspicious activity such as privilege escalation, exposed secrets, or anomalous behavior in containers.
- **Automated Response Actions**: Security analysts can isolate or terminate compromised pods directly from the Defender portal to contain threats quickly [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/investigate-respond-container-threats).
- **Incident Graph and Attack Paths**: Analysts can visualize the full scope of an attack, identify lateral movement paths, and take preventive actions [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/investigate-respond-container-threats).
- **Threat Analytics**: Provides intelligence on container-specific threats and attack techniques to guide response decisions.
- **Workflow Planning**: Use the Microsoft Defender portal to define incident workflows, assign roles, classify incidents, and track remediation progress [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

This planning supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that container threats are detected and contained quickly, minimizing the impact of potential attacks.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without a defined incident response plan, container threats may go undetected or unresolved, increasing the risk of lateral movement, data exfiltration, and prolonged attacker presence.
