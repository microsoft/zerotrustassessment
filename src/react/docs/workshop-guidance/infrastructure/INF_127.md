# Investigate Resource Health

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must regularly review Defender for Cloud dashboards and resource health pages to identify and act on security recommendations and alerts.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Investigating resource health in Microsoft Defender for Databases helps security teams monitor the protection status of database resources across Azure and multicloud environments. The **Resource Health** page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a centralized view of each resourceâ€™s security posture, including applied Defender plans, outstanding recommendations, and active alerts.

### Key Capabilities

- **Resource Overview**  
  View metadata such as resource group, subscription, and geographic location.

- **Security Features**  
  Check whether Microsoft Defender plans are enabled for the resource.

- **Recommendations and Alerts**  
  Two dedicated tabs show:
  - Outstanding security recommendations (e.g., missing vulnerability assessments, misconfigurations).
  - Active security alerts (e.g., suspicious queries, privilege escalations).

- **Actionable Insights**  
  Admins can drill down into each recommendation or alert to understand the issue and take remediation steps.

### How to Access

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.  
2. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Inventory**.  
3. Select a resource (e.g., SQL Database, SQL Server on Machine).  
4. Review the **Resource Health** pane for:
   - Subscription and monitoring status  
   - Enabled security features  
   - Lists of recommendations and alerts [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/investigate-resource-health)

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by continuously evaluating the security posture of each resource and ensuring that all configurations and protections are up to date. Skipping this step may result in undetected vulnerabilities or delayed responses to active threats.
