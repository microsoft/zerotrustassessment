# Enhanced Reporting

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Setting up and using enhanced reporting requires configuration by security teams and integration with incident response workflows.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend monitoring and analysis activity; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Enhanced reporting in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides deep visibility into threats, vulnerabilities, and remediation progress across cloud environments. One of the key features is the **Threat Intelligence Report**, which is automatically generated when a security alert is triggered. These reports include detailed insights such as:

- Attacker identity and associations
- Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Campaign and activity group context
- Mitigation and remediation guidance

There are three types of reports:

- **Activity Group Report** – Focuses on attacker profiles and objectives.
- **Campaign Report** – Details specific attack campaigns.
- **Threat Summary Report** – Combines both attacker and campaign insights.

These reports are accessible directly from the **Security Alerts** page in Defender for Cloud and can be downloaded as PDFs for sharing or archiving. Enhanced reporting supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling faster, more informed incident response and continuous threat awareness [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/threat-intelligence-reports).
