# Review & Remediate VM Secrets Security Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must review secrets-related recommendations, analyze metadata, and remediate exposed secrets across Azure, AWS, and GCP virtual machines.

**User Impact:** Low  
Secrets remediation is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Servers includes **secrets scanning** capabilities that detect plaintext secrets—such as credentials, tokens, and keys—stored on virtual machines. These secrets can pose a serious lateral movement risk if compromised. Defender for Cloud generates **recommendations** when secrets are discovered, helping teams prioritize and remediate them effectively.

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** or **Defender CSPM** must be enabled.
- **Agentless scanning** must be turned on.
- Machines must be supported Azure VMs, AWS EC2, or GCP Compute Engine instances [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-server-secrets).

### How to Review Secrets Recommendations

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
2. Expand the **Remediate vulnerabilities** security control.
3. Look for one of the following:
   - *"Machines should have secrets findings resolved"* (Azure)
   - *"EC2 instances should have secrets findings resolved"* (AWS)
   - *"VM instances should have secrets findings resolved"* (GCP)
4. Expand **Affected resources** to view the list of machines with secrets findings.
5. In the **Findings** section, select a secret to view:
   - File path
   - Last access time
   - Token expiration (if applicable)
   - Whether the secret’s target resource still exists [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-server-secrets).

### How to Remediate

- Follow the **Remediation steps** listed in the recommendation.
- Remove or rotate the exposed secret.
- Reconfigure the application or script to use secure storage (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
- Optionally, drill into the **Inventory > Secrets tab** on a specific VM to review and act on secrets directly [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-server-secrets).

### Additional Tools

- Use **Cloud Security Explorer** to query secrets across your environment.
- Prioritize secrets based on exposure (e.g., internet-facing assets) and attack paths [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/secrets-scanning).

Failing to remediate secrets can lead to credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by identifying and eliminating sensitive data exposure on endpoints.
