# Remediate Assessment

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Remediation requires IT and Security Operations teams to review, prioritize, and act on security recommendations across multiple cloud environments, which may involve scripting or manual configuration.

**User Impact:** Low  
Remediation actions are typically performed by administrators or security teams; end users are not directly involved or impacted.

## Overview

In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, **remediation of assessments** refers to the process of addressing security recommendations that are generated after evaluating your cloud resources against built-in or custom security standards. These recommendations help organizations improve their security posture by identifying misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or non-compliant settings across Azure, AWS, and GCP environments.

Security recommendations are prioritized by risk level and aligned with the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB), which influences your secure score. Admins can remediate issues manually, use the **Fix** button for quick actions, or apply **automated remediation scripts** for scaleâ€”especially in multi-cloud environments. If remediation is not performed, organizations risk leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed, which could lead to breaches or compliance failures.

This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring continuous assessment and proactive mitigation of risks, reducing the attack surface and improving resilience.
