# Remediate & Review Security Risk Concerns via Cloud Security Explorer

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must use graph-based queries and contextual insights to identify and remediate risks across cloud environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Cloud Security Explorer in Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables security teams to proactively identify and remediate security risks that could impact databases and other sensitive assets. It uses graph-based path-finding queries to analyze misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and lateral movement opportunities across Azure, AWS, and GCP environments.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Run Security Risk Queries**  
   - Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Cloud Security Explorer**.  
   - Use built-in or custom queries to identify:
     - Misconfigured database access
     - Publicly exposed data stores
     - Secrets stored in plaintext on VMs [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-attack-path)

2. **Explore Contextual Attack Paths**  
   - Combine asset metadata (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, access level) with security findings.  
   - Identify how attackers could move laterally from one resource to another to reach sensitive databases [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-attack-path).

3. **Review Secrets and Sensitive Data Risks**  
   - Use queries to find secrets on machines that could lead to database compromise.  
   - Review metadata such as last access time, token expiration, and exposure level [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-server-secrets).

4. **Remediate Findings**  
   - Go to **Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.  
   - Select relevant recommendations (e.g., “Machines should have secrets findings resolved”).  
   - Expand **Affected resources** and follow the **Remediation steps** provided [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-server-secrets).

5. **Prioritize Based on Risk**  
   - Focus on assets exposed to the internet or those with access to sensitive data.  
   - Use the **Attack Path Analysis** tool to validate whether a finding is part of a known attack path [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/data-security-review-risks).

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by identifying and closing potential attack vectors before they can be exploited. Without using Cloud Security Explorer, organizations may miss complex, multi-step risks that expose databases to compromise.
