# Enable Defender for Key Vault

**Implementation Effort:** Low — Enabling Defender for Key Vault is a simple configuration task in the Azure portal and does not require changes to application code or infrastructure.

**User Impact:** Low — This change is transparent to end users and does not require any user interaction or communication.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Key Vault provides advanced threat protection for Azure Key Vault by detecting unusual and potentially harmful access attempts. It helps secure sensitive assets such as encryption keys, secrets, and certificates by monitoring for suspicious activity and generating alerts.

To enable Defender for Key Vault:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
3. In the left menu, select **Environment settings**.
4. Choose the relevant subscription.
5. On the **Defender plans** page, toggle the **Key Vault** plan to **On**.
6. Click **Save** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-key-vault-plan).

Once enabled, Defender for Key Vault will:

- Monitor access patterns to detect anomalies.
- Generate alerts for suspicious activity, such as access from unfamiliar IPs or unusual usage patterns.
- Provide recommendations for investigation and remediation [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-key-vault-introduction).

This feature supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by continuously monitoring for threats and enabling rapid response to potential compromises. Without this protection, unauthorized access to secrets and keys may go undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches and service disruption.
