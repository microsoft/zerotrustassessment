# Real-time Monitoring and Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must configure Defender for Databases plans and integrate alert handling into their incident response workflows.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators and security teams; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Real-time monitoring and response in Microsoft Defender for Databases enables organizations to detect and respond to threats targeting their database environments across Azure, on-premises, and multicloud platforms. Defender for Databases provides continuous monitoring, anomaly detection, and real-time alerts enriched with threat intelligence.
