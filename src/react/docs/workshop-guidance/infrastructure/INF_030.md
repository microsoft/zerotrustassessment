# Enable Endpoint Protection

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Defender for Endpoint integration across supported Windows Server versions, including hybrid and multicloud environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
Endpoint protection is enabled and managed by administrators; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Enabling **endpoint protection** in Microsoft Defender for Servers involves configuring **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** and integrating with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** to provide real-time protection, threat detection, and response capabilities for Windows Server workloads.

### Supported Server Versions

- **Windows Server 2016 and later**: Microsoft Defender Antivirus is installed by default.
- **Windows Server 2012 R2**: Requires onboarding to Defender for Endpoint using the modern unified solution [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server).

### Key Steps to Enable Protection

1. **Install or Verify Microsoft Defender Antivirus**:
   - Use **PowerShell** or the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** to install or enable the antivirus and its GUI if needed [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server).

2. **Enable Real-Time Protection Features**:
   - Configure behavior monitoring, heuristics, and machine learning-based detection [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus).

3. **Enable Network Protection**:
   - Use Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard settings to turn on network filtering and protection [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection).

4. **Integrate with Defender for Endpoint**:
   - Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2 include MDE onboarding.
   - Use Azure Policy or scripts to automate onboarding and configuration.

5. **Agentless or Agent-Based Deployment**:
   - Choose between agentless scanning (Plan 2) or agent-based protection using MDE.

Properly enabling endpoint protection ensures that server workloads are continuously monitored and defended against malware, exploits, and advanced threats. This supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by reducing the attack surface and enabling rapid detection and response.
