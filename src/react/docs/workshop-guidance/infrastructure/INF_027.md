# Plan Defender for Servers Deployment

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Planning requires security and IT teams to evaluate server workloads, choose the appropriate Defender for Servers plan, and configure deployment scope and methods across Azure and hybrid environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
Deployment planning and execution are handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Planning a deployment of **Defender for Servers** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud involves selecting the right plan (Plan 1 or Plan 2), determining the deployment scope (subscription or resource level), and configuring the necessary integrations and policies.

- **Plan 1** includes core endpoint detection and response (EDR) via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- **Plan 2** adds advanced features such as agentless scanning, vulnerability management, file integrity monitoring, just-in-time access, and compliance assessments [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan).

**Deployment Scope Options:**

- **Subscription-level**: Recommended for broad coverage and easier management.
- **Resource-level**: Offers granularity, useful for phased rollouts or specific workloads.

**Deployment Methods:**

- Use Azure Policy or scripts to enable plans based on resource tags or groups.
- Plan 1 can be enabled/disabled at the resource level.
- Plan 2 must be enabled at the subscription level but can be selectively disabled per resource [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan).

Proper planning ensures consistent protection, avoids coverage gaps, and aligns with organizational security and compliance goals. This supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring all server workloads are proactively protected and monitored.
