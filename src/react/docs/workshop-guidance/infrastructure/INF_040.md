# Investigate Resource Health

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must regularly review the health status of resources, analyze alerts and recommendations, and take remediation actions using Defender for Cloud’s resource health page.

**User Impact:** Low  
Resource health investigations are performed by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Investigating **resource health** in Microsoft Defender for Servers allows security teams to assess the security posture of individual resources—such as virtual machines, databases, and containers—across Azure, AWS, GCP, and hybrid environments. The **resource health page** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a centralized view of each resource’s security state, including applied Defender plans, outstanding recommendations, and active alerts.

### Key Capabilities

- View **resource metadata**: subscription, region, resource group, and Defender plan status.
- Analyze **security recommendations**: configuration issues, missing agents, or outdated software.
- Review **active alerts**: threats detected by Defender for Endpoint or other integrated tools.
- Take **remediation actions** directly from the portal.

### How to Investigate Resource Health

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Inventory**.
3. Select any resource (e.g., VM, SQL DB, container).
4. The **resource health page** opens, showing:
   - Overview of the resource’s configuration and Defender plan status.
   - Tabs for **Recommendations** and **Alerts**.
   - Counts of outstanding issues and actionable insights [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/investigate-resource-health).

### Permissions Required

- To apply recommendations: `Resource Group Contributor`, `Owner`, or `Subscription Contributor`.
- To dismiss alerts: `Security Admin` or `Subscription Owner` [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/investigate-resource-health).

### Why It Matters

- Helps identify **unhealthy resources** that are non-compliant with security baselines.
- Enables **prioritization of remediation** based on severity and impact.
- Supports **continuous monitoring** and **incident response** workflows.

Failing to investigate resource health regularly can result in undetected misconfigurations or threats. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring that all resources are continuously assessed and secured.
