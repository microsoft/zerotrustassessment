# Determine API Workload Protection Requirements

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
This requires IT and Security teams to assess API traffic, onboard APIs into Azure API Management, and configure Defender for APIs plans based on usage.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only administrators and security teams are involved in setup and monitoring; no end-user action is required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for APIs is a security solution within Microsoft Defender for Cloud that provides full lifecycle protection for APIs. It helps organizations detect threats, monitor API usage, and improve their API security posture. To determine protection requirements, organizations must first ensure APIs are published in Azure API Management, then enable Defender for APIs at the subscription level. Choosing the right pricing plan is critical, as it depends on the volume of API traffic. Defender for APIs also provides security recommendations, such as removing unused APIs and improving authentication practices.

Failing to determine and configure appropriate protection requirements can result in unmonitored API traffic, increased exposure to threats, and unexpected billing overages. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by continuously monitoring API traffic and detecting anomalies in real time.
