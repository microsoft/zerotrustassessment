# Plan Defender for Containers Deployment

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires planning across Kubernetes environments, onboarding clusters, and configuring sensors and policies.

**User Impact:** Low – Deployment is handled by platform and security teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Planning a deployment of **Microsoft Defender for Containers** involves preparing your Kubernetes environments (Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises) to support container security capabilities such as vulnerability assessment, runtime threat detection, and security posture management. Defender for Containers integrates with **Azure Arc** for hybrid and multicloud clusters and supports both agent-based and agentless monitoring.

Key planning steps include:

- **Enable the Defender for Containers plan** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud using the Azure portal, REST API, or ARM templates [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable).
- **Deploy the Defender sensor** to Kubernetes clusters to enable runtime threat detection and telemetry collection.
- **Configure Azure Policy add-ons** to enforce governance and collect control plane data.
- **Integrate with container registries** (e.g., Azure Container Registry, Amazon ECR, GCP Artifact Registry) for vulnerability scanning.
- **Review the containers support matrix** to ensure compatibility with your cloud provider and Kubernetes version [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction).
- **Enable gated deployment** to secure your container software supply chain by validating images before deployment [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-gated-deployment).

This planning ensures that all container workloads are protected from build to runtime, aligning with the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust.
