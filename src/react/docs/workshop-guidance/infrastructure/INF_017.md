# Determine Compliance Requirements

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – This requires collaboration between security, compliance, and cloud operations teams to identify applicable standards and configure assessments across cloud platforms.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend configuration and monitoring task; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Determining compliance requirements in Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a foundational step in building a secure and compliant multicloud environment. Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your cloud resources against industry and regulatory standards such as:

- **Azure Security Benchmark (ASB)** – Default for all Azure subscriptions.
- **AWS Standards** – Includes AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, CIS 1.2.0, and PCI DSS 3.2.1.
- **GCP Standards** – Includes GCP Default, CIS 1.1.0/1.2.0, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and PCI DSS 3.2.1.

Each cloud connector (Azure, AWS, GCP) comes with a default benchmark, and additional standards can be added once enhanced security features are enabled. Organizations can also define **custom compliance standards** to align with internal policies or regional regulations [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-multicloud-security-determine-compliance-requirements).

This activity supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by ensuring that all cloud resources are continuously evaluated against relevant compliance controls, helping to identify misconfigurations and reduce risk exposure.
