# Review & Remediate Guest Configuration Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must ensure the guest configuration extension is deployed, review OS-level misconfigurations, and apply remediations based on Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) baselines.

**User Impact:** Low  
Guest configuration remediation is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Servers uses the **Azure Policy machine configuration extension** (formerly known as Guest Configuration) to assess operating system settings against security baselines. These baselines are defined by the **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)** and help organizations harden their server environments.

When misconfigurations are detected, Defender for Cloud generates **recommendations** that guide remediation efforts for both Windows and Linux machines.

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** must be enabled.
- The **Azure Policy machine configuration extension** must be installed on each machine.
- Avoid using the deprecated **Log Analytics agent (MMA)** to prevent duplicate recommendations [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/apply-security-baseline).

### How to Review Guest Configuration Recommendations

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
2. Look for:
   - *"Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Windows machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)"*
   - *"Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Linux machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)"*
3. Select the recommendation to view:
   - Affected resources
   - Specific misconfigurations
   - Suggested remediation steps [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/apply-security-baseline)

### How to Remediate

- Follow the **Remediation steps** provided in the recommendation details.
- Use **Azure Resource Graph** queries to identify and track misconfigurations at scale.
- Apply configuration changes manually or automate them using **Azure Policy**, **PowerShell**, or configuration management tools [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/apply-security-baseline).

### Additional Tools

- **Azure Resource Graph**: Enables querying of unhealthy rules and affected machines.
- **Security Exposure Management**: Provides a centralized view of OS-level misconfigurations and other posture gaps.

Failing to remediate guest configuration findings can result in non-compliance and increased exposure to threats. This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** and **"Assume Breach"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring all systems are continuously assessed and hardened.
