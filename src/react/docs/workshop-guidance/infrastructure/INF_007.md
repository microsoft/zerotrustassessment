# Set Up Security Policies

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Setting up security policies involves selecting, customizing, and assigning standards across cloud environments, which requires coordination between security, compliance, and cloud operations teams.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend configuration task; end users are not directly affected unless policy enforcement impacts resource configurations.

## Overview

Security policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud define the rules and standards used to assess and improve your cloud security posture. These policies are built on **security standards**, which include Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB), regulatory compliance standards (e.g., ISO, NIST, PCI-DSS), and custom standards tailored to your organization’s needs.

Defender for Cloud evaluates resources in Azure, AWS, and GCP against these standards and generates **security recommendations** to guide remediation. You can modify built-in standards, assign regulatory frameworks, or create custom policies using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to define specific conditions and remediation steps.

This setup supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by continuously assessing configurations and enforcing compliance with defined security baselines across all cloud environments.
