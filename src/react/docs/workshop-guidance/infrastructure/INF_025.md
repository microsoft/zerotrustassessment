# Determine Server Workload Protection Requirements

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must assess server environments across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises, select the appropriate Defender for Servers plan, and configure integrations like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or agentless scanning.

**User Impact:** Low  
Server protection setup is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Determining server workload protection requirements in Microsoft Defender for Cloud involves selecting the right **Defender for Servers** plan and configuring the necessary components to secure virtual machines (VMs) across cloud and hybrid environments. Defender for Servers supports Azure VMs, AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, and on-premises machines via Azure Arc [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-servers-overview).

There are two main plans:

- **Plan 1**: Includes Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) integration for basic threat detection and vulnerability management.
- **Plan 2**: Adds advanced capabilities like file integrity monitoring, adaptive application controls, and just-in-time VM access [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-multicloud-security-determine-multicloud-dependencies).

Protection can be delivered through:

- **Agentless scanning** (recommended for simplicity and coverage)
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration**
- **Azure Arc agent** for hybrid/on-premises workloads

The **Workload Protections Dashboard** helps visualize coverage and identify unprotected resources. If server workloads are not properly protected, organizations risk exposure to malware, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring all server workloads are continuously monitored and hardened against threats.
