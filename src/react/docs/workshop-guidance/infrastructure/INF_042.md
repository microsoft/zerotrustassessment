# Review & Remediate Endpoint Detection and Response Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must review EDR-related recommendations, validate agent presence, and take remediation actions across Azure, AWS, and GCP workloads.

**User Impact:** Low  
EDR remediation is handled by administrators; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Servers integrates with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** to provide **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** capabilities. Defender for Cloud continuously assesses whether supported machines have a valid EDR solution installed and running. If gaps are found, it generates recommendations to help security teams remediate them.

### Key Capabilities

- **Agentless scanning** is used to detect EDR presence on Azure VMs, AWS EC2, and GCP Compute Engine instances.
- Recommendations are generated when:
  - No EDR solution is detected.
  - A non-Microsoft EDR is unsupported.
  - Defender for Endpoint is not properly configured [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/endpoint-detection-response-solution-recommendations).

### How to Review EDR Recommendations

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
2. Search for:
   - *"EDR solution should be installed on Virtual Machines"*
   - *"EDR solution should be installed on EC2s"*
   - *"EDR solution should be installed on Virtual Machines (GCP)"*
3. Select a recommendation to view affected resources.
4. Use the **Healthy resources** tab to verify which machines already have EDR installed [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/endpoint-detection-response-solution-recommendations).

### How to Remediate

1. Select the recommendation and click **Fix**.
2. Choose **Enable Defender for Endpoint integration**.
3. Select one or more affected machines.
4. Click **Enable** to automatically install the Defender for Endpoint sensor.
5. Wait up to 24 hours for the machine to appear under **Healthy resources** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/endpoint-detection-response-solution-recommendations).

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** or **Defender CSPM** must be enabled.
- **Agentless scanning** must be turned on (enabled by default in supported plans).
- Machines must be supported by Defender for Endpoint (Windows or Linux).

Failing to remediate EDR recommendations leaves workloads vulnerable to undetected threats and weakens incident response capabilities. This supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring all endpoints are monitored and protected.
