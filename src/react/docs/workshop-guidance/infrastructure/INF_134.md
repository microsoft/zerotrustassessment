# Remediate & Review Vulnerability Assessments

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must enable vulnerability assessments, review findings, and apply remediations across Azure SQL and other supported databases.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Databases includes a built-in **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)** tool that scans Azure SQL databases and other supported platforms for security misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and known vulnerabilities. These assessments help organizations proactively reduce risk and improve compliance.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Enable Vulnerability Assessment**  
   - Defender for Cloud automatically enables VA when the **Defender for Azure SQL** plan is active.  
   - You can choose between:
     - **Classic configuration** (requires a storage account)  
     - **Express configuration** (recommended; no storage account needed) [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-enable-classic).

2. **Run and Schedule Scans**  
   - Scans can be run manually or scheduled weekly.  
   - Results are stored in a designated storage account (classic) or managed internally (express).  
   - Email notifications can be sent to admins and subscription owners [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-enable-classic).

3. **Review Findings**  
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations** or the specific SQL resource.  
   - Review categorized findings such as:
     - Missing encryption
     - Unpatched software
     - Excessive permissions [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-find).

4. **Remediate Vulnerabilities**  
   - Each finding includes remediation guidance.  
   - You can:
     - Apply fixes manually
     - Use automation (e.g., Azure Policy, Logic Apps)
     - Disable findings if they are not applicable [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-find).

5. **Track and Audit**  
   - Use the Defender for Cloud dashboard to monitor remediation progress.  
   - Export scan results for compliance reporting or integration with SIEM tools [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview).

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that known vulnerabilities are identified and resolved before they can be exploited. Without regular assessments, organizations risk leaving critical database assets exposed to threats.
