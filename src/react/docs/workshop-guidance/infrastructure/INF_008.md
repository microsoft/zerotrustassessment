# Set Up Continuous Export

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – This setup requires configuration by security administrators and may involve coordination with SIEM/SOAR teams or Log Analytics owners.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend integration task; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Setting up continuous export in Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables organizations to stream or periodically export security alerts and recommendations to external systems such as **Azure Log Analytics**, **Azure Event Hubs**, or third-party **SIEM/SOAR** platforms. This allows for deeper analysis, long-term retention, and integration with incident response workflows.

Administrators can configure exports to stream data in real time (when a resource’s health state changes) or send weekly snapshots. Filters can be applied to export only specific data types, such as high-severity alerts or specific compliance assessments. Export can be configured via the Azure portal, REST API, or at scale using Azure Policy templates.

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that security data is continuously monitored and available for advanced analytics, threat hunting, and automated response.
