# Review & Remediate API Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Reviewing and remediating API recommendations requires ongoing collaboration between security teams and API owners to assess findings, prioritize risks, and implement fixes.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are handled by administrators and security teams; no direct user involvement is required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for APIs continuously evaluates onboarded APIs and generates **security recommendations** to help organizations improve their API security posture. These recommendations are visible in the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** portal and are based on real-time analysis of API configurations, traffic patterns, and exposure levels.

Common recommendations include:

- **Enable Defender for APIs**: Ensures APIs are protected with runtime threat detection [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-api).
- **Onboard APIs to Defender for APIs**: Required for visibility and protection [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-api).
- **Remove unused API endpoints**: APIs with no traffic for 30+ days should be retired to reduce attack surface [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-api).
- **Enforce authentication**: APIs should validate tokens, certificates, or subscription keys to prevent unauthorized access [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-api).
- **Scope API subscriptions properly**: Avoid assigning subscriptions to all APIs to minimize data exposure [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-api).

To remediate:

1. Open **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
2. Navigate to **Recommendations** under **API Security**.
3. Review each recommendationâ€™s severity and impact.
4. Follow the guided remediation steps or use automation tools like **Azure Policy**, **Power Automate**, or **Microsoft Sentinel** for enforcement.

Neglecting to review and act on these recommendations can leave APIs vulnerable to misconfigurations, unauthorized access, and data leaks. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Use least privilege access"** by enforcing proper access controls and minimizing unnecessary exposure.
