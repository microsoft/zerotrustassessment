# Plan for Incident Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires coordination between security operations, IT, and compliance teams to define workflows, configure automation, and integrate with monitoring tools.

**User Impact:** Low — Incident response planning is handled by administrators and SOC teams; no direct user interaction is required.

## Overview

Planning for incident response in Microsoft Defender for Storage ensures that your organization can detect, contain, and recover from threats targeting storage resources. Defender for Storage integrates with Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel to provide a unified incident response experience.

### Key Components of an Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection and Triage**
   - Use Defender for Storage alerts (e.g., malware detection, unusual access patterns) to trigger incident creation.
   - Prioritize incidents based on severity, affected assets, and data sensitivity.
   - Use automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel to triage and assign incidents automatically [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze the full attack story using the incident graph in the Microsoft Defender portal.
   - Review related alerts, affected users, devices, and storage accounts.
   - Use the **Evidence and Response** tab to gather forensic data [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

3. **Containment and Eradication**
   - Block access to malicious files using ABAC or RBAC.
   - Isolate affected storage accounts or disable compromised identities.
   - Delete or quarantine malicious blobs as needed [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

4. **Recovery**
   - Restore affected storage resources from backups or snapshots.
   - Re-enable access controls and validate that the threat has been removed.

5. **Post-Incident Review**
   - Document the incident, response actions, and lessons learned.
   - Update playbooks, policies, and configurations to prevent recurrence.
   - Use Threat Analytics to understand broader attack trends [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

### Tools and Integrations

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Central hub for alerts and recommendations.
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: SIEM/SOAR platform for automation and advanced analytics.
- **Logic Apps**: Automate response workflows (e.g., notifications, remediation).
- **Microsoft Purview**: Classify and prioritize incidents involving sensitive data.

Without a defined incident response plan, organizations may face delayed containment, increased data exposure, and regulatory non-compliance.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by ensuring rapid detection, containment, and recovery from storage-related threats.
