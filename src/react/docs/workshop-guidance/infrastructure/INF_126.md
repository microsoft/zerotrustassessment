# Check Resource Coverage

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must use Azure tools like Resource Graph Explorer and Defender for Cloud dashboards to validate which resources are protected.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Checking resource coverage in Microsoft Defender for Databases ensures that all intended database workloads—across Azure, on-premises, and multicloud—are actively protected. This process involves verifying that Defender plans are enabled and that resources are being scanned and monitored correctly.

### Key Methods

1. **Use Defender for Cloud Recommendations**  
   - Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations** in the Azure portal.  
   - Search for recommendations like:  
     - *SQL databases should have vulnerability findings resolved*  
     - *SQL servers on machines should have vulnerability findings resolved*  
   - These show which resources are covered and which are missing protection [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-scan-results).

2. **Query Azure Resource Graph (ARG)**  
   - Use **Resource Graph Explorer** to run Kusto queries that return affected resources or security findings.  
   - Example:  

     ```kusto
     securityresources
     | where type =~ "microsoft.security/assessments/subassessments"
     | project resourceId, name=properties.displayName, status=properties.status.code
     ```

   - This helps identify gaps in coverage and validate that Defender for SQL is actively scanning the databases [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-scan-results).

3. **Review Defender Plan Activation**  
   - Ensure the following Defender plans are enabled:  
     - Defender for Azure SQL Databases  
     - Defender for SQL Servers on Machines  
     - Defender for Open-Source Relational Databases  
     - Defender for Azure Cosmos DB [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-databases-plan)

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by ensuring that all database resources are accounted for and protected. Skipping this step may result in unmonitored workloads, increasing the risk of undetected threats or compliance gaps.
