# Review & Remediate Kubernetes CIS Benchmark

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
This task involves enabling Kubernetes policy monitoring, reviewing CIS benchmark recommendations, and applying remediations across clusters using Azure Policy or manual configuration updates.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only security and platform engineering teams are involved in the remediation process; end users are not affected.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Containers supports **Kubernetes CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmark assessments** by continuously evaluating Kubernetes clusters against industry-standard security best practices. These assessments are surfaced as **recommendations** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud and help organizations harden their Kubernetes environments.

To review and remediate CIS benchmark issues:

- Ensure **Defender for Containers** is enabled and Azure Policy for Kubernetes is configured.
- Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
- Filter recommendations by **Kubernetes CIS benchmark** or search for specific controls (e.g., "Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false").
- Review each recommendation, which includes:
  - Affected clusters
  - Severity level
  - Remediation steps
  - Links to external documentation
- Apply remediations by:
  - Updating Kubernetes API server or kubelet configurations
  - Applying Azure Policy definitions or Gatekeeper constraints
  - Re-deploying workloads with secure settings

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Use Least Privilege Access"** by enforcing strict configuration baselines and reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without CIS benchmark enforcement, Kubernetes clusters may remain misconfigured, exposing them to privilege escalation, unauthorized access, and lateral movement risks.
