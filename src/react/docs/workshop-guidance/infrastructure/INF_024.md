# Monitor Compliance Findings

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Setting up and maintaining compliance monitoring involves configuring standards, reviewing dashboards, and possibly integrating with reporting tools like Azure Monitor workbooks.

**User Impact:** Low  
Compliance monitoring is handled by security and compliance teams; end users are not directly affected or required to take action.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a **Regulatory Compliance Dashboard** that continuously assesses your cloud environment against industry and regulatory standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and Azure-specific benchmarks. These standards are broken down into **compliance controls**, which group related security recommendations. Defender for Cloud automatically evaluates your resources against these controls and displays their compliance status as **compliant**, **non-compliant**, or **unavailable** (if automatic assessment isn't possible).

The dashboard allows security teams to:

- View compliance status by standard and control
- Drill down into failed assessments for remediation guidance
- Track compliance trends over time using Azure Monitor workbooks
- Export audit-ready reports for internal or external review

If compliance findings are not monitored, organizations risk failing audits, missing regulatory obligations, and exposing themselves to security vulnerabilities. This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that compliance is continuously validated based on real-time data and assessments.
