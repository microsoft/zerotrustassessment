# Automate Response to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Setting up automation requires configuring Logic Apps or Power Automate flows, defining triggers and actions, and testing workflows across services.

**User Impact:** Low — These automations are executed by backend systems and security teams, with no direct impact on end users unless containment actions are triggered.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud supports automated responses to security alerts across services like App Service, Key Vault, and Resource Manager. These automations help reduce response time, enforce consistency, and minimize manual intervention.

### Automation Options

#### 1. **Workflow Automation with Logic Apps**

- Trigger Logic Apps based on:
  - Security alerts
  - Recommendations
  - Regulatory compliance changes
- Example actions:
  - Send email notifications
  - Disable a resource
  - Create a ticket in an ITSM system [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation)

#### 2. **Power Automate Integration**

- Defender for Cloud Apps integrates with Power Automate to trigger custom playbooks when alerts are generated.
- Example use cases:
  - Automatically create a ServiceNow ticket
  - Send approval emails for governance actions
  - Change alert status or trigger remediation scripts [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/flow-integration)

### Steps to Automate Response

1. **Create a Logic App or Power Automate Flow**:
   - Use the **Defender for Cloud** or **Defender for Cloud Apps** connector.
   - Define the trigger: “When an alert is generated.”
   - Add actions: email, HTTP request, Azure Function, etc.

2. **Configure in Defender for Cloud**:
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Workflow automation**.
   - Add a new automation rule and link it to your Logic App [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).

3. **Test and Monitor**:
   - Simulate alerts to validate the workflow.
   - Monitor execution logs and adjust logic as needed.

### Best Practices

- Use conditions and filters to avoid over-triggering.
- Include logging and alert status updates in your flows.
- Regularly review automation effectiveness and update playbooks.

These automations align with the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring rapid, consistent, and policy-driven responses to threats.
