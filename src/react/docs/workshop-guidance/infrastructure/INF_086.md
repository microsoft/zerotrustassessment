# Review & Remediate Attack Path Risks

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
This task involves enabling Defender for Containers, analyzing attack path graphs, and coordinating with security and platform teams to remediate misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only security and infrastructure teams are involved in reviewing and remediating attack paths; end users are not affected.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Containers includes **attack path analysis**, a graph-based feature that identifies exploitable paths attackers could use to move laterally and reach high-value assets in your containerized environments. These paths are visualized in the **Cloud Security Explorer**, which helps security teams prioritize and break attack chains before they are exploited.

To review and remediate attack path risks:

- Enable **Defender for Containers** and ensure agents are deployed on relevant clusters [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-attack-path).
- Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Attack Paths**.
- Review attack paths sorted by:
  - Risk level
  - Entry point
  - Target asset
  - Affected resources
  - Active recommendations
- Investigate insights such as:
  - Pods exposed to the internet
  - Privileged containers
  - Containers using host networking
  - Vulnerable container images [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-test-attack-path-and-security-explorer-with-vulnerable-container-image)
- Apply remediations by:
  - Updating Kubernetes configurations
  - Restricting network exposure
  - Rebuilding vulnerable images
  - Enforcing policies to prevent insecure deployments

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by proactively identifying and eliminating lateral movement paths that attackers could exploit within Kubernetes environments.

**Risks if not implemented:** Unaddressed attack paths can allow adversaries to escalate privileges, move laterally, and compromise sensitive workloads, increasing the likelihood of a successful breach.
