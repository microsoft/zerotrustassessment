# Onboard Docker Hub

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires Docker Hub account configuration and secure integration with Microsoft Defender for Containers.

**User Impact:** Low – Onboarding is handled by security and DevOps teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Onboarding **Docker Hub** in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** enables vulnerability scanning and security posture assessment of container images stored in Docker Hub. This integration allows Defender for Containers to apply the same security capabilities used for cloud-native registries like Azure Container Registry (ACR), Amazon ECR, and Google GCR [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/agentless-vulnerability-assessment-docker-hub).

### Steps to Onboard Docker Hub

1. **Create a Dedicated Docker Hub User**:
   - Use your organization's Docker Hub account to create a dedicated user (e.g., `mdc_user@contoso.com`).
   - Assign the user the **Editor** role across all repositories.
   - The user will receive a verification email—complete the verification process [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable-external-registry-for-docker-hub).

2. **Generate a Read-Only Access Token**:
   - Sign in as the dedicated user.
   - Generate a **read-only access token** to be used by Defender for Cloud.
   - Save the token and username securely [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable-external-registry-for-docker-hub).

3. **Configure the Docker Hub Connector in Defender for Cloud**:
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**.
   - Select your subscription and navigate to **Container registries**.
   - Add a new **Docker Hub connector** and provide the dedicated username and access token [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable-external-registry-for-docker-hub).

Once connected, Defender for Containers will begin scanning images in Docker Hub for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that only validated and secure container images are used in your environments.
