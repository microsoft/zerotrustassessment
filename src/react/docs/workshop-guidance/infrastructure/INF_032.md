# Enable Agentless Scanning for Machines

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must validate plan eligibility, review supported VM configurations, and enable agentless scanning through Defender for Cloud settings.

**User Impact:** Low  
Agentless scanning is transparent to end users and managed entirely by administrators.

## Overview

**Agentless scanning** in Microsoft Defender for Servers provides vulnerability, malware, and secrets scanning without requiring any agents or network configuration on the virtual machines. It is designed to improve security posture while minimizing operational overhead and performance impact.

### Key Capabilities

- Scans for:
  - Software inventory
  - Vulnerabilities
  - Secrets
  - Malware (Plan 2 only)
- No agent installation or network configuration required
- Scans run once every 24 hours on running VMs only

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** or **Defender CSPM** must be enabled
- Supported environments:
  - **Azure VMs** (up to 4TB total disk, max 6 disks)
  - **AWS EC2** and **GCP Compute Instances**
  - **Kubernetes node VMs** (with Defender for Containers or Plan 2)

### How to Enable Agentless Scanning

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**
2. Select the relevant **subscription**
3. Under **Defender CSPM** or **Defender for Servers Plan 2**, click **Settings**
4. In **Settings and monitoring**, toggle **Agentless scanning for machines** to **On**
5. Click **Save** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-agentless-scanning-vms)

### Limitations

- Unsupported disk types: UltraSSD_LRS, PremiumV2_LRS
- Unsupported file systems: UFS, ReFS, ZFS
- Only scans VMs that are powered on

Failing to enable agentless scanning may result in missed vulnerabilities and malware threats, especially in environments where agent deployment is restricted. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring continuous, low-friction visibility into machine security posture.
