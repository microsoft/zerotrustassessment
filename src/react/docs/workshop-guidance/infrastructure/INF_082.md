# Review & Remediate Kubernetes Node Vulnerability Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
This task requires enabling vulnerability assessments, reviewing CVE findings, and coordinating with platform teams to upgrade node pool images or Kubernetes versions.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only infrastructure and security teams are involved in reviewing and remediating vulnerabilities; end users are not affected.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Containers provides **vulnerability assessments for Kubernetes nodes** by scanning the virtual machines (VMs) that host the nodes. These assessments identify OS-level and software vulnerabilities and generate actionable recommendations for remediation.

To review and remediate vulnerabilities:

- Navigate to **Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
- Select the recommendation: **"AKS nodes should have vulnerability findings resolved"**.
- Review the list of CVEs under the **Findings** tab, which includes affected node pools and clusters.
- Select a CVE to view detailed information and impacted resources.
- Click **Fix** to begin remediation.

Remediation typically involves:

- **Upgrading the node pool VM image** to a newer version.
- Optionally, **upgrading the Kubernetes cluster version** if required.
- Enabling **auto-upgrade** for node pools and clusters to maintain security posture.

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that known vulnerabilities in the infrastructure layer are promptly identified and mitigated, reducing the attack surface.

**Risks if not implemented:** Unpatched Kubernetes nodes may expose the cluster to known exploits, increasing the risk of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or container escape attacks.
