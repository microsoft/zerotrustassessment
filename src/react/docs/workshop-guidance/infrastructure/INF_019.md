# Assign Security Standards

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Assigning standards requires administrative access and coordination with compliance and security teams to align cloud environments with regulatory and organizational requirements.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend configuration task; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Assigning security standards in Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables continuous assessment of your cloud environments against industry and regulatory benchmarks. These standards include frameworks such as:

- **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)** – Default for Azure, AWS, and GCP.
- **CIS Benchmarks**, **NIST 800-53**, **PCI DSS**, **ISO 27001**, and others depending on the cloud provider.

To assign a standard:

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Regulatory compliance**.
3. Select **Manage compliance policies**.
4. Choose the scope (Azure subscription, AWS account, or GCP project).
5. Select **Security policies**.
6. Toggle the desired standard to **On** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/update-regulatory-compliance-packages).

Once assigned, Defender for Cloud continuously evaluates resources within the selected scope and provides compliance scores, control-level assessments, and remediation guidance. Standards can be applied at the subscription, management group, or organizational level.

This activity supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by ensuring that cloud resources are continuously monitored against trusted compliance frameworks, helping to identify misconfigurations and reduce risk exposure.
