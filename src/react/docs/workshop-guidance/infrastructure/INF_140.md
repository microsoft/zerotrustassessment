# Manage Alert Suppression Rules

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must define, configure, and maintain suppression rules to reduce alert fatigue while preserving visibility into critical threats.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Managing alert suppression rules in Microsoft Defender for Databases helps reduce noise from known or benign alerts, allowing security teams to focus on high-priority threats. Suppression rules can be applied to alerts that are triggered repeatedly by trusted tools, processes, or configurations that are not considered risky in the organizationâ€™s context.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Create Suppression Rules**  
   - Suppression rules can be created for alerts that have already been triggered.  
   - Use the **Defender for Cloud REST API** to retrieve the alert and define a suppression rule based on its properties [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules).

2. **Manage Rules via API**  
   - You can view, edit, or delete suppression rules using the Defender for Cloud API.  
   - This allows for automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines or custom security tooling [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules).

3. **Rule Scope and Conditions**  
   - Rules can be scoped to specific alert types, resource groups, or environments.  
   - Conditions may include alert severity, affected resource type, or specific metadata fields [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules).

4. **Review and Audit**  
   - Regularly review suppression rules to ensure they are still valid.  
   - Avoid suppressing alerts that could indicate evolving threats or misconfigurations.

5. **Best Practices**  
   - Use suppression sparingly and only for well-understood, low-risk alerts.  
   - Document the rationale for each rule and periodically reassess its necessity.

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that alert suppression is intentional, controlled, and does not hide critical threats. Without proper management, suppression rules can create blind spots in your security monitoring.
