# Manage Alert Suppression Rules

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Creating and managing suppression rules is a straightforward administrative task that can be done through the Azure portal or REST API without requiring infrastructure changes.

**User Impact:** Low  
This is a backend configuration task handled by security teams; end users are not affected.

## Overview

In **Microsoft Defender for Containers**, alert suppression rules help reduce noise by automatically dismissing alerts that are known false positives or not relevant to your environment. This allows security teams to focus on high-priority threats while maintaining visibility into suppressed activity.

### Key Capabilities

- **Suppress recurring false positives** or alerts that are not actionable.
- **Apply rules at scale** across subscriptions or management groups.
- **Simulate suppression** to preview the impact before applying.
- **Set expiration dates** to ensure rules are periodically reviewed.

### How to Create a Suppression Rule

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Security Alerts**.
2. Select an alert you want to suppress.
3. Click **Take action > Suppress similar alerts > Create suppression rule**.
4. Configure:
   - **Entities**: Scope the rule to specific resources or apply globally.
   - **Name**: Must be 2â€“50 characters, starting with a letter or number.
   - **State**: Enabled or disabled.
   - **Reason**: Choose a predefined reason or enter a custom one.
   - **Expiration date**: Optional, to automatically disable the rule later.
5. Use **Simulate** to preview how many past alerts would have been suppressed.
6. Save the rule.

You can also manage suppression rules via the **Defender for Cloud REST API** for automation and integration into CI/CD or security workflows [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-suppression-rules).

This supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by allowing teams to document and control exceptions while maintaining alert hygiene and visibility.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without suppression rules, security teams may face alert fatigue, increasing the risk of missing critical threats due to noise from low-priority or false-positive alerts.
