# Automate Response to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires configuration of automation workflows, integration with Event Grid, and use of Azure services like Logic Apps or Function Apps.

**User Impact:** Low — Automation is handled by security teams and systems; no direct user interaction is required.

## Overview

Automating responses to alerts in Microsoft Defender for Storage helps organizations reduce response time, contain threats quickly, and streamline incident handling. Defender for Storage integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to generate alerts and supports automation through Event Grid, Logic Apps, and other Azure-native tools.

### Key Automation Capabilities

- **Event Grid Integration**: Defender for Storage emits events based on malware scan results and security alerts. These events can trigger automated workflows [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).
- **Blob Index Tags**: Files can be tagged as `clean`, `malicious`, or `unscanned`, enabling conditional logic in automation workflows [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).
- **Security Alerts**: Alerts from Defender for Cloud can be used to initiate automated responses such as containment or notification [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/introduction-malware-scanning).

### Common Automated Response Actions

1. **Block Access to Malicious or Unscanned Files**
   - Use Microsoft Entra ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) to restrict access based on scan results [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

2. **Delete or Quarantine Malicious Files**
   - Automatically delete blobs flagged as malicious (enable soft delete for recovery).
   - Move malicious files to a secure quarantine container or storage account with restricted access using Microsoft Entra RBAC [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

3. **Trigger Logic Apps or Function Apps**
   - Automate notifications to SOC teams, log incidents, or initiate further remediation steps [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/introduction-malware-scanning).

4. **On-Demand Scanning for Incident Response**
   - Use on-demand scanning to validate or investigate files in response to alerts [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/on-demand-malware-scanning).

### Best Practices

- Use predefined templates in Logic Apps for common response scenarios.
- Regularly review and test automation workflows to ensure effectiveness.
- Ensure proper access controls on quarantine containers to prevent unauthorized access.

Without automation, response times may be delayed, increasing the risk of data exposure and operational disruption.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by enabling rapid, consistent, and scalable responses to storage-related threats.
