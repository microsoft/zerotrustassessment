# Determine Response Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires configuration of automated workflows, access controls, and integration with security operations tools.

**User Impact:** Low — Response strategies are implemented by administrators and security teams; no direct user interaction is required.

## Overview

Determining a response strategy in Microsoft Defender for Storage involves planning and implementing automated actions to contain and remediate threats detected through malware scanning and other security signals. A well-defined response strategy ensures that malicious files are handled quickly and securely, reducing the risk of data breaches and operational disruption.

### Key Response Options

1. **Block Access to Malicious or Unscanned Files**  
   Use Microsoft Entra Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to restrict access to blobs based on malware scan results. This ensures only clean files are accessible to users and applications [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

2. **Delete Malicious Files**  
   Automatically delete blobs flagged as malicious. It is recommended to enable soft delete on the storage account to allow recovery in case of false positives [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

3. **Move to Quarantine**  
   Transfer malicious files to a dedicated container or storage account with restricted access. Use Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC to ensure only authorized personnel (e.g., SOC analysts) can access the quarantined data [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

4. **Tag Files for Automation**  
   Apply Blob Index Tags to scanned files to label them as clean, malicious, or unscanned. These tags can trigger automated workflows or be used for filtering and reporting [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

5. **Trigger Automated Workflows**  
   Use Event Grid events or Defender for Cloud alerts to initiate Logic Apps or other automation tools for incident response, such as notifying security teams or logging incidents [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

### Strategic Considerations

- Align response actions with your organization’s incident response plan.
- Ensure integration with SIEM/SOAR platforms like Microsoft Sentinel.
- Regularly test and update workflows to adapt to evolving threats.

Failing to define and implement a response strategy can result in delayed containment, increased exposure, and non-compliance with data protection policies.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by ensuring threats are automatically contained and remediated based on real-time detection.
