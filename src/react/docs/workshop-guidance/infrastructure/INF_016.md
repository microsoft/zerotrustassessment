# Leverage 3rd Party Integrations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Integrating third-party tools requires configuration by security teams and may involve API setup, connector deployment, and policy tuning.

**User Impact:** Low – These integrations operate in the background and do not directly affect end users unless policy enforcement changes are applied.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud supports a wide range of third-party integrations to enhance visibility, automate response, and extend protection across hybrid and multicloud environments. These integrations allow organizations to unify their security operations by connecting Defender for Cloud with external tools such as:

- **Threat Intelligence (TI) Feeds**: Import custom IP ranges and indicators from third-party TI platforms to enrich alert context and improve detection accuracy [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/additional-integrations).
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM) / Mobile Threat Defense (MTD)**: Integrate with third-party MDM/MTD solutions to assess device compliance and enforce session controls based on device trust [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/additional-integrations).
- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: Connect external UEBA platforms to detect anomalous behavior and apply adaptive access controls via Microsoft Entra ID [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/additional-integrations).
- **IT Service Management (ITSM)**: Integrate with platforms like **ServiceNow** to automate ticket creation and track remediation of security recommendations [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/partner-integration).
- **Partner Security Solutions**: Use built-in connectors to integrate with partner tools for runtime protection, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/integrate-partner-integrations).

These integrations support the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling continuous monitoring, faster incident response, and deeper context for threat detection and remediation.
