# Build Remediation Logic

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuration of remediation workflows, integration with Microsoft Intune or automation tools, and coordination between security and IT teams.

**User Impact:** Low – Remediation actions are handled by IT and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Building remediation logic in **Microsoft Defender for Servers** involves setting up workflows to address vulnerabilities and threats identified by Defender for Endpoint and Defender Vulnerability Management. Security teams can initiate remediation requests directly from the **Microsoft Defender portal**, targeting specific vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. These requests can be routed to **Microsoft Intune** for execution, enabling IT administrators to deploy patches, configuration changes, or software updates at scale.

Remediation logic can also be automated using **Automated Investigation and Remediation (AIR)** capabilities, which allow predefined actions to be taken when threats are detected—such as isolating a device, removing malicious files, or restoring affected components. These workflows reduce response time and ensure consistent handling of threats across environments.

This capability supports the **"Use Least Privilege Access"** and **"Assume Breach"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring that remediation actions are controlled, auditable, and executed with minimal exposure to risk.
