# Enable Vulnerability Scanning

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must configure vulnerability scanning across Azure, hybrid, and multicloud environments using either agentless or agent-based methods.

**User Impact:** Low  
Vulnerability scanning is managed by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Servers includes integrated **vulnerability scanning** capabilities through **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM)**. This helps identify weaknesses in server workloads across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments.

### Scanning Methods

- **Agentless Scanning**:
  - Enabled by default with **Defender for Servers Plan 2** or **Defender CSPM**.
  - Requires no software installation on the VM.
  - Ideal for quick deployment and broad coverage.

- **Agent-Based Scanning**:
  - Available with **Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2**.
  - Uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or other supported agents.
  - Offers deeper insights and real-time protection.

### How to Enable Vulnerability Scanning

1. **Navigate to Defender for Cloud > Environment Settings**.
2. Select the relevant **subscription**.
3. Under **Monitoring coverage**, choose the **Defender for Servers plan** and click **Settings**.
4. In **Settings and monitoring**, turn on **Vulnerability assessment for machines**.
5. Click **Edit configuration** to choose an assessment solution (e.g., MDVM).
6. Click **Apply** and **Save** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management).

### For Individual Machines

- Go to the **Inventory** page and filter for **Unhealthy resources**.
- Look for the recommendation: *"Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution."*
- Follow the remediation steps to enable scanning on those machines.

Failing to enable vulnerability scanning can leave critical vulnerabilities undetected, increasing the risk of exploitation. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by proactively identifying and mitigating weaknesses before they are exploited.
