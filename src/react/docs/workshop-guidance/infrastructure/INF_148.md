# Build Remediation Logic

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Building remediation logic requires integration with automation tools like Microsoft Sentinel or Power Automate, and coordination between security operations and development teams.

**User Impact:** Low  
Remediation actions are automated or handled by administrators; no direct user involvement is required.

## Overview

In Microsoft Defender for APIs, remediation logic refers to the automated or guided response actions taken when threats or misconfigurations are detected in API workloads. While Defender for APIs itself focuses on detection and posture management, remediation workflows can be built using integrations with tools like **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**, and **Power Automate**.

Typical remediation logic includes:

- Automatically disabling or throttling suspicious API endpoints.
- Triggering alerts and ticket creation in ITSM systems.
- Launching Power Automate flows to notify owners or revoke access.
- Using Defender for Cloud recommendations to guide manual remediation.

To build remediation logic:

1. Connect Defender for APIs to Microsoft Sentinel or Logic Apps.
2. Define alert rules and playbooks based on API threat detections.
3. Use Power Automate to trigger workflows from Defender for Cloud alerts [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/tutorial-flow).
4. Monitor remediation effectiveness and adjust logic as needed.

Without remediation logic, threats may be detected but not acted upon, increasing the risk of prolonged exposure. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by ensuring rapid, automated response to API threats.
