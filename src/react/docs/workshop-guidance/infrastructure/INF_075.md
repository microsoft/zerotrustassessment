# Setup Multicloud Connectors

**Implementation Effort:** High  
Setting up multicloud connectors requires configuring integrations with AWS, GCP, and potentially on-prem Kubernetes clusters, which involves coordination across cloud teams, identity, and network configurations.

**User Impact:** Low  
This setup is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly impacted or required to take action.

## Overview

Setting up multicloud connectors in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** enables security visibility and threat protection across Kubernetes clusters hosted in **AWS (EKS)**, **Google Cloud (GKE)**, and **on-premises environments** via **Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes**. This configuration allows Defender for Cloud to monitor workloads, detect threats, and enforce security policies across heterogeneous environments.

The process involves:

- Connecting AWS and GCP accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Enabling Defender for Containers on those cloud environments.
- Ensuring network connectivity for telemetry and threat data to flow into Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- Optionally using automation to deploy connectors at scale.

This setup supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by extending threat detection and visibility across all containerized environments, reducing blind spots and enabling faster incident response.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without these connectors, container workloads in non-Azure environments remain unmonitored, increasing the risk of undetected threats and compliance gaps.
