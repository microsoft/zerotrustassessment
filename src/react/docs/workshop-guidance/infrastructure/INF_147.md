# Track Onboarded API Resources

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Tracking onboarded APIs is a straightforward task for security administrators using the Defender for Cloud portal.

**User Impact:** Low  
This activity is limited to administrators and security teams; no end-user involvement is required.

## Overview

Once APIs are onboarded into Microsoft Defender for APIs, security teams can track their status and security posture directly in the **Defender for Cloud** portal. This visibility is essential for ensuring that all critical APIs are protected and monitored for threats.

To track onboarded APIs:

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to **Workload protections > API security**.
3. Review the list of onboarded APIs, their protection status, and any associated security recommendations or alerts [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-deploy).

You can also explore additional insights such as:

- API inventory grouped by sensitivity or exposure.
- Active threats and alerts tied to specific APIs.
- Posture recommendations to improve API security [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/protect-with-defender-for-apis) [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-posture).

Failing to track onboarded APIs may result in blind spots, where APIs are assumed to be protected but are not actively monitored. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by ensuring continuous visibility and validation of API protection coverage.
