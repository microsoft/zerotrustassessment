# Prioritize and Respond to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuration of alert rules, integration with SIEM/SOAR tools, and training of security operations teams to triage and respond effectively.

**User Impact:** Low – Alert handling is managed by security teams; no direct impact on end users.

## Overview

In **Microsoft Defender for Servers**, alert prioritization and response are essential for effective threat detection and mitigation. Defender for Cloud collects and analyzes telemetry from cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments to generate security alerts. These alerts are automatically classified by severity and mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, helping security teams understand the context and potential impact of each threat.

Security analysts can triage alerts by filtering based on severity, time, and affected resources. Each alert includes detailed metadata such as IP addresses, processes, and kill chain stage. Analysts can take actions like inspecting resource context, applying manual remediation steps, triggering automated responses via Logic Apps, or suppressing false positives. Integration with **Microsoft Sentinel** or other SIEM/SOAR platforms allows for centralized alert management and automation.

This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that all alerts are treated as potential threats and responded to with urgency and precision.
