# Plan a Lifecycle Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires coordination between security, IT, and compliance teams to define onboarding, monitoring, and decommissioning processes.

**User Impact:** Low — Lifecycle planning is handled by administrators and security teams; no direct user interaction is required.

## Overview

Planning a lifecycle strategy in Microsoft Defender for Storage ensures that storage security is consistently applied from resource creation through decommissioning. A well-defined lifecycle strategy helps maintain visibility, compliance, and protection across all storage accounts in Azure.

Key components of a lifecycle strategy include:

- **Onboarding**: Automatically enable Defender for Storage at the subscription level to ensure all new storage accounts are protected by default. Use Azure Policy to enforce consistent onboarding and prevent misconfigurations.
  
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
  - Continuously monitor activity using Defender for Storage’s telemetry from the data and control planes.
  - Enable features like malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection to enhance visibility and reduce risk.
  - Regularly review resource health and coverage to ensure no storage accounts are left unprotected.

- **Alert Management and Response**:
  - Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel or other SIEM/SOAR tools for centralized alert handling.
  - Build remediation logic using Event Grid, Logic Apps, or automation runbooks to respond to threats in real time.

- **Decommissioning**:
  - Ensure that storage accounts being retired are removed from monitoring and that any sensitive data is securely deleted or archived.
  - Audit logs and alerts should be retained for compliance and forensic purposes.

Without a lifecycle strategy, organizations risk inconsistent protection, missed alerts, and compliance gaps. This planning supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by ensuring continuous protection and visibility throughout the resource lifecycle.
