# Prioritize and Respond to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Prioritizing and responding to alerts requires configuring alert rules, integrating with incident response tools, and training security teams to triage and act on alerts effectively.

**User Impact:** Low — These actions are performed by security teams and automation systems, with no direct impact on end users unless containment actions are triggered.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides real-time security alerts for services like App Service, Key Vault, and Resource Manager. These alerts are prioritized based on severity and mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to help security teams understand the intent and impact of detected threats.

### Alert Prioritization

- Alerts are automatically classified by severity: **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.
- Prioritize **High severity** alerts first, especially those indicating active exploitation or lateral movement [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts).
- Use filters in the **Security alerts** blade to focus on recent or critical alerts (e.g., last 24 hours, specific resource types).

### Investigation and Response

1. **Access Alerts**:
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Security alerts**.
   - Filter by service (App Service, Key Vault, Resource Manager) or severity.

2. **Investigate Alerts**:
   - Select an alert to view its description, affected resources, and kill chain intent.
   - Use the **Alert details** tab to examine IPs, processes, and other indicators of compromise [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts).

3. **Take Action**:
   - Use the **Take action** tab to:
     - Inspect resource context (activity logs).
     - Apply manual remediation steps.
     - Trigger automated responses via Logic Apps.
     - Suppress false positives if needed [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts).

4. **Integrate with SIEM/SOAR**:
   - Stream alerts to Microsoft Sentinel or other SIEM/SOAR platforms for centralized monitoring and orchestration [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts).

These practices align with the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring that every alert is investigated and responded to with full context and automation where possible.
