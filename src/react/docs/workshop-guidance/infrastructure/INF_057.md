# Automate Agent Deployment

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires scripting, onboarding package management, and integration with deployment tools like Azure Arc, Microsoft Intune, or custom automation.

**User Impact:** Low – Deployment is handled by IT and security teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Automating agent deployment in **Microsoft Defender for Servers** ensures consistent protection across hybrid and multicloud environments. Defender for Servers relies on the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent** and the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** to collect telemetry and enforce security policies. Automation reduces manual errors, speeds up onboarding, and ensures that all machines are protected from the moment they are provisioned.

For **Linux servers**, Microsoft provides an **installer script** that detects the OS distribution, configures the appropriate repository, installs the latest agent version, and onboards the device using a downloaded onboarding package. This script can be executed manually or integrated into configuration management tools like **Ansible**, **Chef**, or **Puppet** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/linux-installer-script).

For **Windows and hybrid environments**, automation can be achieved using **Group Policy**, **Microsoft Intune**, or **Azure Arc**. These tools allow centralized deployment and policy enforcement, ensuring that agents are installed and configured as part of the server provisioning process [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-agents).

This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that all machines are onboarded and monitored from the start, reducing the risk of unmanaged or unmonitored assets.
