# Review & Remediate Vulnerability Assessments

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must review vulnerability findings, prioritize remediation based on severity, and apply fixes using agentless or agent-based scanning tools.

**User Impact:** Low  
Vulnerability remediation is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Servers provides integrated **vulnerability assessment** capabilities using **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM)**. It supports both **agentless** and **agent-based** scanning to detect vulnerabilities across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises machines.

### Scanning Methods

- **Agentless Scanning**:
  - Requires **Defender for Servers Plan 2**.
  - No software installation needed.
  - Scans run daily on powered-on VMs [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm).

- **Agent-Based Scanning**:
  - Available with **Plan 1 or Plan 2**.
  - Uses the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** agent.
  - Offers deeper insights and real-time protection [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm).

### How to Review Vulnerability Findings

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
2. Search for: *"Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved"*.
3. View all findings across subscriptions, ordered by severity.
4. To filter by VM:
   - Open **Affected resources** and select a VM.
   - Or go to **Inventory > Resource Health**, select a VM, and view its findings [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm).

### How to Remediate

1. Select a vulnerability to open the **details pane**.
2. Review:
   - CVE references
   - Severity level
   - Remediation steps
3. Apply the recommended fix (e.g., patching, configuration change).
4. Use **Azure Resource Graph** to export and track findings across environments [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm).

### Additional Tools

- **Azure Resource Graph (ARG)**: Export findings for reporting and automation.
- **Cloud Security Explorer**: Query and filter vulnerabilities by severity, resource type, or environment.

Failing to remediate vulnerabilities leaves workloads exposed to known exploits and compliance risks. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring continuous detection and mitigation of weaknesses.
