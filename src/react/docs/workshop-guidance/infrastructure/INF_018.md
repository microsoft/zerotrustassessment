# Enable Defender CSPM Plan

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Enabling the plan requires administrative access to Azure subscriptions and coordination with cloud security teams to activate and configure advanced posture management features.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend configuration task; end users are not directly affected unless policy enforcement or scanning results lead to changes in resource configurations.

## Overview

The **Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides advanced capabilities to assess, visualize, and improve your cloud security posture. While **Foundational CSPM** is enabled by default and free, the **Defender CSPM plan** is a paid upgrade that unlocks features such as:

- **Governance and regulatory compliance**
- **Cloud Security Explorer**
- **Attack path analysis**
- **Agentless scanning for machines**

To enable the Defender CSPM plan:

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.
3. Select the relevant **Azure subscription**, **AWS account**, or **GCP project**.
4. On the **Defender plans** page, toggle **Defender CSPM** to **On**.
5. Click **Save**.

> ⚠️ Note: Only **Subscription Owners** can enable agentless scanning. If a user with lower permissions enables the plan, some features like attack path analysis may not function fully [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-cspm-plan).

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling continuous visibility into misconfigurations, attack paths, and compliance gaps across multicloud environments.
