# Plan a Lifecycle Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires planning across onboarding, configuration, scaling, and decommissioning phases, involving collaboration between security, IT, and cloud architecture teams.

**User Impact:** Low – Lifecycle planning is handled by administrators and architects; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Planning a lifecycle strategy in **Microsoft Defender for Servers** ensures that server protection is consistent, scalable, and aligned with organizational security goals. The lifecycle includes onboarding machines (Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises), configuring monitoring and protection policies, maintaining agent health, scaling deployments, and eventually decommissioning resources securely.

Key planning steps include:

- Selecting the appropriate **Defender for Servers plan** (Plan 1 or Plan 2) based on feature needs and cost.
- Onboarding machines using **Azure Arc** for hybrid and multicloud environments.
- Ensuring integration with **Log Analytics workspaces** and **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** for data collection.
- Defining governance for agent deployment, update management, and alert handling.
- Planning for **decommissioning** by removing agents, disabling plans, and cleaning up resources.

This strategy supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that all machines are consistently monitored and protected throughout their lifecycle, reducing gaps in visibility and control.
