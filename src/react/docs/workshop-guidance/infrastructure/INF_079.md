# Plan a Lifecycle Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Planning a lifecycle strategy requires coordination across security, DevOps, and platform teams to align container security practices with development and operational workflows.

**User Impact:** Low  
This is a backend planning and implementation activity handled by security and DevOps teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Planning a lifecycle strategy in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** ensures that container security is embedded throughout the entire container lifecycle—from development to deployment and runtime. This includes integrating security into CI/CD pipelines, monitoring container registries, enforcing runtime protections, and managing decommissioning of resources.

Key lifecycle phases include:

- **Build phase**: Integrate vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines and container registries.
- **Deploy phase**: Ensure secure configurations and enable Defender sensors across Kubernetes clusters.
- **Run phase**: Monitor workloads for threats, misconfigurations, and compliance issues using Defender’s runtime protection and threat intelligence.
- **Retire phase**: Remove unused resources and revoke access to reduce attack surface.

This strategy supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by continuously validating the security posture of containers and automating responses to threats across all lifecycle stages.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without a defined lifecycle strategy, container environments may suffer from inconsistent security coverage, delayed threat detection, and increased exposure to supply chain attacks.
