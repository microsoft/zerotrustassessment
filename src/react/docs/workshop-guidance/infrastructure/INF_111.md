# Review & Remediate Attack Path Risks

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires enabling Defender CSPM, reviewing attack path analysis, and remediating high-risk recommendations across storage and related resources.

**User Impact:** Low — This is a backend security operation; users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Storage, through its integration with Defender for Cloud, provides **Attack Path Analysis** to help identify and remediate risks that could lead to data breaches. Attack paths are visual representations of how attackers could move laterally through your environment to reach sensitive storage resources.

### Key Capabilities

- **Context-aware risk prioritization**: Attack paths are ranked by severity using a proprietary algorithm that considers exposure, sensitivity, and exploitability [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-attack-path).
- **Multicloud visibility**: Attack paths span Azure, AWS, and GCP environments.
- **Data-centric filtering**: You can filter attack paths that specifically target sensitive data in storage accounts [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/data-security-review-risks).

### How to Review Attack Paths

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to **Attack path analysis**.
3. Select an attack path to view its structure.
4. Click on a **node** to view insights and associated **recommendations**.
5. Use filters like **Sensitive data** to focus on high-impact risks [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/data-security-review-risks).

### How to Remediate Attack Paths

1. From the **Attack path analysis** view, select an attack path.
2. Click **Remediation**.
3. Review and apply the recommended actions, such as:
   - Disabling public access to storage
   - Enforcing secure transfer (HTTPS)
   - Enabling malware scanning or sensitive data discovery
   - Restricting access using private endpoints or RBAC [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-attack-path)

### Prerequisites

- Defender CSPM must be enabled.
- Agentless scanning should be active.
- Required roles: Security Reader, Security Admin, Contributor, or Owner [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-attack-path).

Failing to review and remediate attack paths can leave your storage accounts exposed to lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by proactively identifying and closing exploitable paths to sensitive storage resources.
