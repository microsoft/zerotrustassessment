# Real-time Monitoring and Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and configuration of Defender for Cloud policies and plans.

**User Impact:** Low – Actions are handled by security and IT administrators; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Real-time monitoring and response in **Microsoft Defender for Servers** is a core capability of **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** that helps organizations detect, investigate, and respond to threats targeting their server infrastructure. It leverages integration with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to provide **endpoint detection and response (EDR)**, **behavioral analytics**, and **live response** capabilities. These features enable security teams to identify suspicious activity, analyze threats, and take immediate action—such as isolating a machine or collecting forensic data—without user disruption.

Defender for Servers supports both **agent-based** and **agentless** monitoring, and works across **multicloud** (Azure, AWS, GCP) and **on-premises** environments. It uses **machine learning**, **threat intelligence**, and **behavioral monitoring** to detect threats in near real-time. If not deployed, organizations risk delayed detection of attacks, limited visibility into server activity, and slower incident response.

This capability aligns with the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by enabling continuous monitoring, rapid threat detection, and containment to minimize the impact of potential intrusions.
