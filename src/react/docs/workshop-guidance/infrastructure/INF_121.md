# Plan Defender for Database Deployment

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must assess their database estate, enable appropriate Defender plans, and configure multicloud integrations.

**User Impact:** Low  
Deployment is handled by administrators; no direct user interaction or notification is required.

## Overview

Planning the deployment of Microsoft Defender for Databases involves identifying the types of databases in use (Azure SQL, SQL Server on machines, open-source relational databases, and Azure Cosmos DB) and enabling the corresponding Defender plans. Each plan provides tailored threat protection and security management capabilities.

Deployment steps include:

- Ensuring Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled on the Azure subscription.
- Connecting non-Azure environments (AWS, GCP) if applicable.
- Enabling the **Databases plan**, which activates all four Defender modules:
  - Defender for Azure SQL Databases
  - Defender for SQL Servers on Machines
  - Defender for Open-Source Relational Databases
  - Defender for Azure Cosmos DB
- Optionally, enabling and configuring each plan individually for more granular control.

This planning process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring proactive threat detection and response across all supported database environments. Without proper planning and deployment, organizations risk leaving critical data assets unprotected and vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access.
