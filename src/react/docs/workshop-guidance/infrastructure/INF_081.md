# Determine Containers Security Posture Goals

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Defining security posture goals requires collaboration between security, DevOps, and compliance teams to align Defender for Containers capabilities with organizational risk tolerance and operational needs.

**User Impact:** Low  
This is a strategic planning activity handled by internal teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Determining container security posture goals in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** involves setting clear objectives for how containerized workloads should be protected across their lifecycle. Defender for Containers supports this by offering capabilities in four key domains:

- **Security posture management**: Continuously monitors Kubernetes APIs and workloads to detect misconfigurations, assess risk, and provide mitigation guidance.
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Performs agentless scans of container images and running workloads, offering remediation insights and exploitability context.
- **Runtime threat protection**: Detects active threats using Microsoft threat intelligence and maps findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Deployment & monitoring**: Ensures sensors are deployed and operational across all clusters, and flags unmonitored resources [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction).

To define posture goals, organizations should:

- Identify critical container assets and their risk exposure.
- Set baseline configurations and compliance requirements.
- Establish thresholds for acceptable vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Plan for continuous monitoring and automated remediation.

This aligns with the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by ensuring that all container resources are continuously assessed and validated against defined security standards.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without clear posture goals, container environments may lack consistent protection, leading to unmanaged risks, delayed threat detection, and compliance failures.
