# Build Remediation Logic

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Building remediation logic requires setting up automation workflows using Azure Logic Apps, which involves configuration, testing, and role-based access setup.

**User Impact:** Low — These automations are triggered by security events and handled by backend systems, with no direct impact on end users.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud allows you to automate remediation actions across services like App Service, Key Vault, and Resource Manager using **Workflow Automation**. This feature helps reduce response time, enforce consistency, and minimize manual intervention in incident response processes.

### Key Capabilities

- **Trigger Conditions**: Automations can be triggered by security alerts, recommendations, or compliance changes.
- **Logic Apps Integration**: You can define workflows using Azure Logic Apps to perform actions such as sending alerts, disabling accounts, or applying configuration changes [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).

### Example Use Cases

- **Defender for App Service**: Automatically enforce HTTPS or disable a misconfigured app when a high-severity alert is triggered.
- **Defender for Key Vault**: Trigger an alert and restrict access if unusual access patterns are detected.
- **Defender for Resource Manager**: Revoke elevated permissions or notify admins when suspicious role assignments occur [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).

### Steps to Build Remediation Logic

1. **Access Workflow Automation**:
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Workflow automation**.

2. **Create a New Automation Rule**:
   - Click **Add workflow automation**.
   - Define a name, description, and trigger conditions (e.g., alert severity, resource type).

3. **Link to a Logic App**:
   - Choose an existing Logic App or create a new one.
   - Use built-in templates or define custom flows using connectors (e.g., email, Teams, Azure Functions).

4. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Deploy the Logic App and test it using simulated alerts or recommendations.
   - Monitor execution logs to ensure the workflow behaves as expected [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).

These automations support the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring rapid, consistent, and policy-driven responses to security threats.
