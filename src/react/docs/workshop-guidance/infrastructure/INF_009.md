# Set Up SIEM Integration

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – This requires configuration by security administrators and may involve coordination with SIEM/SOAR teams to ensure proper data ingestion and alert mapping.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend integration task; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Setting up SIEM integration in Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables centralized monitoring and correlation of security alerts across cloud and on-premises environments. Defender for Cloud supports integration with SIEM platforms such as **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Micro Focus ArcSight**, and other generic SIEMs using **Common Event Format (CEF)** or APIs.

There are two main approaches:

- **Native integration with Microsoft Sentinel**: Offers seamless, scalable ingestion of alerts and incidents from Defender for Cloud and other Microsoft security products [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/siem-sentinel).
- **Generic SIEM integration**: Uses a downloadable agent (JAR file) that pulls alerts and activities from Defender for Cloud Apps and streams them into your SIEM [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/siem). Note: This method is being deprecated starting **November 2025**, and organizations are encouraged to transition to **Microsoft Defender XDR Streaming API** or **Microsoft Graph Security API** [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/siem).

This integration supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling continuous monitoring, automated incident response, and correlation of security events across multiple environments.
