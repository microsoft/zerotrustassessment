# Automate Response to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuration of automated investigation and response (AIR) settings, integration with Logic Apps, and tuning of automation rules.

**User Impact:** Low – Automation is handled by security operations; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Automating response to alerts in **Microsoft Defender for Servers** helps security teams handle high volumes of security incidents efficiently. This is achieved through two main capabilities:

1. **Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)** in **Microsoft Defender XDR**: AIR acts like a virtual analyst, automatically investigating alerts, collecting evidence, and taking remediation actions such as isolating machines, stopping malicious processes, or removing files. This reduces response time and allows security teams to focus on more complex threats [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/m365d-autoir) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations).

2. **Workflow Automation in Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: This feature allows organizations to trigger **Azure Logic Apps** in response to specific alerts or recommendations. For example, when a high-severity alert is triggered, a Logic App can automatically notify the SOC team, create a ticket, or initiate remediation steps [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).

Together, these capabilities enable scalable, consistent, and rapid responses to threats across cloud and hybrid environments.

This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that threats are addressed immediately and consistently, minimizing the window of exposure.
