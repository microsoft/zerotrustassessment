# Prerequisites Check

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires validation of environment readiness, network access, and supported configurations across cloud and hybrid Kubernetes environments.

**User Impact:** Low – Prerequisite checks are performed by platform and security teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Before deploying **Microsoft Defender for Containers**, it is essential to perform a thorough prerequisites check to ensure that your Kubernetes environments are compatible and properly configured. This step ensures a smooth onboarding experience and full functionality of Defender features such as runtime protection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance monitoring.

Key prerequisites include:

- **Supported Kubernetes environments**: Defender for Containers supports Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), AWS EKS, GCP GKE, and on-premises clusters via Azure Arc [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable).
- **Network connectivity**: Ensure outbound access to Microsoft Defender for Cloud endpoints. If using **Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)**, configure private endpoints and DNS zones accordingly [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable).
- **Log Analytics workspace**: Required for telemetry collection. The Defender sensor must be able to send data to the configured workspace.
- **Azure Policy and Defender extensions**: Must be installed on clusters to enable governance and control plane monitoring.
- **Containers support matrix**: Validate that your Kubernetes version and OS are supported by reviewing the [Containers support matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/support-matrix-defender-for-containers).

This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that all container environments are validated and monitored from the start, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and blind spots.
