# Deploy Guest Configuration

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must enable Defender for Servers Plan 2, assign managed identities, and deploy the machine configuration extension across Azure, Arc-enabled, and multicloud machines.

**User Impact:** Low  
Guest configuration deployment is handled by administrators; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

**Guest Configuration** in Microsoft Defender for Servers enables continuous assessment of operating system configurations against security baselines, such as the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB). This is achieved using the **Azure Machine Configuration extension**, formerly known as the Azure Policy Guest Configuration extension.

### Key Capabilities

- Assesses OS-level settings on Windows and Linux machines.
- Identifies misconfigurations based on MCSB compute security baselines.
- Supports Azure VMs, Azure Arc-enabled servers (on-premises, AWS, GCP).

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** must be enabled.
- Machines must support the **Azure Machine Configuration extension**.
- **System-assigned managed identity** is required for Azure VMs [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/security-baseline-guest-configuration).

### How to Deploy Guest Configuration

#### For Azure VMs

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings > Your subscription > Settings & Monitoring**.
2. Under **Guest Configuration**, toggle the **Guest Configuration agent (preview)** to **On**.
3. Assign a **system-assigned managed identity** to each VM.
4. Search for and remediate the recommendation:  
   *"Guest Configuration extension should be deployed with system-assigned managed identity."*

#### For Azure Arc-enabled Machines (On-premises, AWS, GCP)

- The extension is installed **automatically** when machines are onboarded via Azure Arc.
- No manual deployment is needed if Arc provisioning is selected during connector setup [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/security-baseline-guest-configuration).

### Automation Options

- Use **Azure Policy**, **ARM templates**, **Bicep**, or **Terraform** to deploy at scale [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/guest-configuration).
- CLI and PowerShell options are also available for scripting deployments.

Failing to deploy guest configuration can result in missed OS-level misconfigurations, reducing visibility into compliance and security posture. This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by continuously validating system configurations against known baselines.
