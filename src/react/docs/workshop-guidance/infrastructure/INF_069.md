# Assign CIS Kubernetes Benchmark

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires enabling Defender for Containers and reviewing benchmark compliance across Kubernetes clusters.

**User Impact:** Low – Benchmark assignment and enforcement are handled by platform and security teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Assigning the **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark** in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** helps organizations align their Kubernetes security posture with industry best practices. The **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** provides a set of security recommendations for Kubernetes environments, categorized into **Level 1 (L1)** for basic security and **Level 2 (L2)** for high-security environments.

In **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, Microsoft Defender for Containers automatically assesses clusters against the **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.27** (as of May 2025), providing visibility into compliance status. Each recommendation is marked as either:

- **Automated** – Can be programmatically assessed and scored.
- **Manual** – Requires manual validation and does not affect the benchmark score.

Assessment results include:

- **Pass** – Recommendation is applied.
- **Fail** – Recommendation is not applied.
- **N/A** – Not applicable to AKS due to architectural differences.
- **Equivalent Control** – Implemented differently but achieves the same outcome [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cis-kubernetes).

To assign and monitor CIS benchmark compliance:

1. Enable **Defender for Containers** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
2. Navigate to **Regulatory Compliance > CIS Kubernetes Benchmark**.
3. Review the compliance dashboard and drill into failed or manual controls.
4. Use the guidance provided to remediate or document exceptions.

This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** and **"Assume Breach"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring Kubernetes clusters are hardened against known risks and continuously monitored for compliance.
