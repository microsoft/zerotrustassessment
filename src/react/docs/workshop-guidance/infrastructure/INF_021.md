# Review Compliance Dashboard

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Reviewing the compliance dashboard requires configuration of standards and regular monitoring by security and compliance teams.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend monitoring and reporting activity; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

The **Regulatory Compliance Dashboard** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a centralized view of your organization’s compliance posture across Azure, AWS, and GCP. It continuously assesses cloud resources against selected compliance standards such as **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)**, **CIS**, **NIST**, **PCI DSS**, and others.

Key capabilities of the dashboard include:

- Viewing which compliance standards are assigned and active.
- Exploring compliance status by **control**, **assessment**, and **resource**.
- Identifying failed assessments and linking directly to remediation guidance.
- Filtering by subscription or cloud provider.
- Viewing detailed control-level insights, including **automated** and **manual** assessments.
- Integration with **Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager** for centralized compliance tracking across cloud and non-cloud assets [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/regulatory-compliance-dashboard).

To access the dashboard:

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to **Regulatory compliance**.
3. Select a standard to view its controls and associated assessments.
4. Drill down into failed controls to view affected resources and remediation steps.

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by ensuring that cloud environments are continuously evaluated against regulatory and organizational compliance requirements.
