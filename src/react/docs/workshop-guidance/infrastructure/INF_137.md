# Plan for Incident Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must define and operationalize incident response workflows using Defender for Cloud and the Microsoft Defender portal.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators and security teams; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Planning for incident response in Microsoft Defender for Databases ensures that your organization can detect, investigate, contain, and recover from database-related security threats. Defender for Databases integrates with Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel to provide a unified view of incidents and alerts across cloud and hybrid environments.

### Key Phases of Incident Response

1. **Detection and Triage**  
   - Use Defender for Cloud to monitor for suspicious database activity (e.g., SQL injection, privilege escalation).  
   - In the Microsoft Defender portal, triage incidents by filtering and sorting based on severity, asset type, and exposure [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

2. **Investigation and Analysis**  
   - Open the incident to view the full attack story, including affected entities, detection sources, and alert timelines.  
   - Use the **Evidence and Response** tab to gather forensic data and understand the scope of the attack [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

3. **Containment and Eradication**  
   - Take immediate actions such as:
     - Disabling compromised accounts  
     - Isolating affected machines  
     - Blocking malicious IP addresses [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response)  
   - Use automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel to accelerate containment.

4. **Recovery**  
   - Restore affected database services and configurations to their pre-incident state.  
   - Validate that all threats have been removed and that monitoring is active.

5. **Post-Incident Review**  
   - Document the incident, root cause, and response actions.  
   - Update playbooks, detection rules, and access policies based on lessons learned.  
   - Use Threat Analytics to research trends and improve future readiness [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

This strategy supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that your organization is prepared to respond quickly and effectively to database threats. Without a defined response plan, incidents may escalate, leading to data loss or prolonged downtime.
