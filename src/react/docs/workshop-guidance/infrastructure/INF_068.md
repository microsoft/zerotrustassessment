# Enable Registry Access

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuration of registry connectors and credentials for external container registries.

**User Impact:** Low – Registry access setup is handled by security and DevOps teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Enabling **registry access** in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** allows Defender to scan container images stored in external registries such as **Docker Hub**, **Google Artifact Registry**, and **Google Container Registry**. This enables vulnerability assessment and compliance monitoring of container images before they are deployed into Kubernetes environments.

### For Docker Hub

1. **Create a dedicated Docker Hub user** with access to all organizational repositories.
2. Assign the user an **Editor** role and verify the email invitation.
3. **Generate a read-only access token** for this user.
4. Use the **Docker Hub connector** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to provide the username and token [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable-external-registry-for-docker-hub).

### For Google Registries

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**.
2. Select your GCP project and go to **Defender plans**.
3. Enable **Registry access** by toggling it to **On**.
4. This enables vulnerability scanning for images in **Google Artifact Registry** and **Google Container Registry** [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable).

This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring that only verified and scanned container images are used in production, reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable or malicious code.
