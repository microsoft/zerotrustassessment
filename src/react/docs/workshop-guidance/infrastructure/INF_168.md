# Determine App Service, Key Vault, and Resource Manager Security Posture Goals

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Defining and aligning security posture goals requires collaboration across security, compliance, and platform teams, and may involve policy customization and continuous monitoring.

**User Impact:** Low — These goals are implemented and enforced by administrators and do not require end-user interaction.

## Overview

Security posture goals in Microsoft Defender for Cloud help organizations define and maintain a secure baseline for critical Azure services like App Service, Key Vault, and Resource Manager. These goals are enforced through built-in policy initiatives and recommendations aligned with industry standards such as CIS and NIST [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/policy-reference).

### App Service

Security posture goals for App Service include:

- Enforcing HTTPS-only traffic.
- Restricting cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
- Enabling diagnostic logging.
- Using managed identities for secure access to other Azure resources [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/policy-reference).

These goals help ensure secure application hosting and align with the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust.

### Key Vault

For Key Vault, posture goals focus on:

- Enabling Defender for Key Vault to detect anomalous access attempts [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-key-vault-introduction).
- Using RBAC instead of access policies.
- Enabling logging and diagnostics.
- Restricting public network access and using private endpoints [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/policy-reference).

These controls support the **"Use Least Privilege Access"** principle by minimizing exposure of sensitive secrets and keys.

### Resource Manager

Security posture goals for Azure Resource Manager include:

- Monitoring control plane operations for suspicious activity.
- Enforcing RBAC and least privilege access.
- Auditing and logging all management operations.
- Preventing unauthorized deployments or role assignments [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/policy-reference).

These goals align with the **"Assume Breach"** principle by ensuring visibility and control over infrastructure-level changes.

Failing to define and enforce these posture goals can lead to misconfigurations, increased attack surface, and undetected malicious activity across your Azure environment.
