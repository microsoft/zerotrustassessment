# Automate Response to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Automating alert responses requires integration with Microsoft Power Automate or SIEM/SOAR tools, and coordination between security operations and platform teams to define workflows.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are handled by security teams; no direct user involvement is required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for APIs supports automation of alert responses by integrating with **Microsoft Power Automate**, allowing security teams to create custom workflows that trigger when specific alerts are generated. This enables faster, consistent, and scalable incident response actions without manual intervention.

### Key Capabilities

- **Trigger-based Automation**: Alerts from Defender for APIs (via Defender for Cloud Apps) can automatically trigger Power Automate flows [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/flow-integration).
- **Custom Playbooks**: Use Power Automate to define actions such as:
  - Creating tickets in ServiceNow or Jira.
  - Sending approval emails or Slack/Teams notifications.
  - Updating alert status or tagging incidents.
- **Policy Integration**: Associate Power Automate playbooks with specific alert policies in Defender for Cloud Apps to ensure targeted automation [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/flow-integration).

### How to Set It Up

1. **Create an API token** in Defender for Cloud Apps.
2. In **Power Automate**, create a new **Automated cloud flow**.
3. Use the **Defender for Cloud Apps connector** and select **"When an alert is generated"** as the trigger [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/flow-integration).
4. Add steps to define your response logic (e.g., notify, escalate, isolate).
5. In Defender for Cloud Apps, go to **Policy Management**, edit the relevant policy, and select **Send Alerts to Power Automate**, then choose your playbook [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/flow-integration).

### Best Practices

- Test playbooks in a staging environment before production use.
- Regularly review and update automation logic to align with evolving threats.
- Use conditional logic to avoid over-responding to low-severity alerts.

Without automation, response times may lag, increasing the risk of damage from API-based attacks. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by enabling rapid, consistent, and scalable responses to detected threats.
