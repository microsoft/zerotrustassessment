# Disable Specific Vulnerability Findings

**Implementation Effort:** Low – Involves targeted configuration by security administrators using the Defender for Cloud portal.

**User Impact:** Low – Disabling findings is an administrative action; end users are not affected.

## Overview

In **Microsoft Defender for Servers**, organizations may choose to disable specific vulnerability findings that are not relevant or actionable in their environment. This helps reduce alert fatigue and ensures that security teams focus on high-priority issues. Disabling findings does not impact the secure score or generate noise in the recommendation list.

Administrators can disable findings by navigating to **Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**, selecting the recommendation **"Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved"**, and using the **"Disable rule"** option under the **Take action** tab. Suppression criteria can include:

- Specific **finding IDs**
- **CVEs**
- **Categories** (e.g., OS type)
- **Security check names**
- **CVSS scores**
- **Severity thresholds**
- **Patchability status**

A justification can be added for auditing purposes. Once applied, the rule may take up to 24 hours to take effect and can be reviewed in the **Disable rule** page.

This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** principle of Zero Trust by allowing organizations to fine-tune their vulnerability management process while maintaining visibility and control over what is intentionally excluded.
