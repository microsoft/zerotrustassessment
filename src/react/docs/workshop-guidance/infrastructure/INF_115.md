# Real-time Monitoring and Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires enabling Defender for Storage features, configuring automation workflows, and integrating with security operations tools.

**User Impact:** Low — Monitoring and response actions are handled by security teams; no direct user interaction is required.

## Overview

Real-time monitoring and response in Microsoft Defender for Storage enables organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to threats targeting Azure Storage accounts. Defender for Storage uses near real-time malware scanning and integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to generate alerts and trigger automated responses.

### Key Capabilities

- **Near Real-Time Malware Scanning**: Automatically scans uploaded blobs for malware using Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It supports all file types, including archives, and provides fast, reliable results [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-introduction) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/introduction-malware-scanning).
- **Security Alerts**: Defender for Cloud generates alerts for suspicious activities such as unusual access patterns, malware uploads, and misconfigurations.
- **Event Grid Integration**: Alerts and scan results can trigger Event Grid events, which can be used to automate responses [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).
- **Blob Index Tags**: Files can be tagged based on scan results (e.g., clean, malicious, unscanned) to support filtering and automation [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).

### Response Options

- **Block Access to Malicious or Unscanned Files**: Use Microsoft Entra ABAC to restrict access based on scan results.
- **Delete or Quarantine Malicious Files**: Automatically delete or move malicious blobs to a secure quarantine container or storage account. Enable soft delete to allow recovery if needed [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan).
- **Trigger Automated Workflows**: Use Logic Apps or other automation tools to notify SOC teams, log incidents, or initiate further remediation steps.

### Best Practices

- Enable Defender for Storage at the subscription level for full coverage.
- Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel for centralized monitoring and incident response.
- Regularly review alerts and update response workflows to adapt to evolving threats.

Without real-time monitoring and response, threats may go undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by ensuring continuous detection and automated containment of threats in storage environments.
