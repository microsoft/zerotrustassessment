# Prioritize and Respond to Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must configure alerting, triage incoming alerts, and define response workflows across Azure and multicloud environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators and security teams; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Databases provides real-time alerts for suspicious activity across Azure SQL, open-source databases, and multicloud environments. These alerts help security teams detect, prioritize, and respond to threats such as SQL injection, brute-force login attempts, and anomalous query behavior.

### Key Steps

1. **Enable Defender Plans**  
   - Ensure Defender for Databases is enabled for Azure SQL, SQL Servers on machines, and open-source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB).  
   - For AWS, connect your account and enable protection for RDS instances [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-usage).

2. **Access Alerts**  
   - Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Security alerts** in the Azure portal.  
   - Use filters to view alerts by severity, resource type, or time.  
   - Alerts are also visible on the resource-specific Defender page and can be sent via email [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-usage).

3. **Prioritize Alerts**  
   - Focus on high-severity alerts involving:
     - Sensitive data
     - Internet-exposed databases
     - Lateral movement indicators  
   - Use the **live tile** on the Defender for Cloud dashboard to track active threats [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-usage).

4. **Investigate and Respond**  
   - Select an alert to view details such as:
     - Affected database and server
     - Nature of the anomaly
     - Recommended remediation steps  
   - Use the **View full alert** link in email notifications to jump directly to the alert in the Azure portal [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-usage).

5. **Remediate and Document**  
   - Follow the recommended actions to mitigate the threat (e.g., revoke access, patch vulnerabilities, block IPs).  
   - Document the incident and update detection rules or access policies as needed.

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that threats are detected and addressed in real time, reducing the window of exposure and improving incident response readiness.
