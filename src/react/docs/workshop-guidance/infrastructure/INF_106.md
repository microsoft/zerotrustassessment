# Investigate Resource Health

**Implementation Effort:** Low — Administrators only need to access the Azure portal and review resource health dashboards; no deployment or scripting is required.

**User Impact:** Low — This is a monitoring and administrative task; no end-user interaction is involved.

## Overview

Investigating resource health in Microsoft Defender for Storage helps security teams assess the current security posture of individual storage accounts and take corrective actions. The **Resource Health** page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a centralized view of:

- Resource metadata (e.g., subscription, region, resource group)
- Defender plan status for the resource
- Outstanding security recommendations
- Active security alerts
To investigate resource health:

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
3. Select **Inventory** and choose a specific storage resource.
4. Review the **Resource Health** pane, which includes:
   - Overview of the resource’s configuration and Defender coverage
   - Tabs for **Recommendations** and **Alerts** relevant to that resource

This view helps identify whether a resource is considered "healthy" or "unhealthy" based on compliance with security recommendations. Even "healthy" resources may have improvement suggestions listed.

If resource health is not regularly reviewed, misconfigurations or threats may go unnoticed, increasing the risk of data exposure or compliance violations.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume Breach"** by ensuring continuous visibility into the security state of cloud storage resources.
