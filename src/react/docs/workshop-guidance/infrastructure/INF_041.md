# Determine Servers Security Posture Goals

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must define baseline security expectations, align with compliance frameworks, and configure Defender for Servers to monitor and improve posture across environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
Security posture goals are defined and managed by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Determining **security posture goals** in Microsoft Defender for Servers involves setting clear objectives for how secure your server workloads should be across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments. These goals guide how Defender for Servers is configured and used to reduce risk, improve compliance, and respond to threats.

### Key Objectives

- **Reduce security risk** by identifying and remediating misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- **Protect against real-time threats** using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and other integrated tools.
- **Align with compliance standards** such as CIS, NIST, and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB).
- **Ensure visibility and coverage** across all server workloads, including hybrid and multicloud environments [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure///defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-servers-overview).

### How Defender for Servers Supports These Goals

- Provides **actionable recommendations** to improve machine configurations.
- Enables **vulnerability scanning**, **file integrity monitoring**, and **just-in-time access**.
- Integrates with **Azure Arc** to onboard non-Azure machines and apply consistent policies.
- Offers **agentless scanning** and **guest configuration** to assess posture without performance impact [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure///defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers).

### Planning Considerations

- Choose the appropriate **Defender for Servers plan** (Plan 1 or Plan 2) based on your goals.
- Define **deployment scope** (subscription-wide or resource-specific).
- Use **Log Analytics workspaces** and **Azure Monitor Agent** to collect and analyze telemetry.
- Regularly review **coverage dashboards** and **resource health pages** to track progress [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure///defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers).

Failing to define and monitor security posture goals can lead to inconsistent protection, compliance gaps, and increased exposure to threats. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring continuous assessment and improvement of server security.
