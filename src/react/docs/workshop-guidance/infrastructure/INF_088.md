# Review & Remediate Security Risk Concerns via Cloud Security Explorer

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
This task involves enabling Defender for Containers, running graph-based queries in Cloud Security Explorer, and coordinating with security and platform teams to remediate identified risks.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only security and infrastructure teams are involved in this process; end users are not affected.

## Overview

The **Cloud Security Explorer** in Microsoft Defender for Containers allows security teams to proactively identify and remediate security risks using **graph-based queries**. It leverages the **cloud security graph** to surface contextual insights such as misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and potential lateral movement paths between resources.

To review and remediate risks:

- Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Cloud Security Explorer**.
- Use built-in or custom queries to identify:
  - Exposed pods or services
  - Privileged containers
  - Containers using host networking
  - Vulnerable container images
  - Misconfigured Kubernetes roles or bindings
- Review the **attack paths** and **resource context** to understand how risks are connected and prioritized [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-test-attack-path-and-security-explorer-with-vulnerable-container-image) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer) [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-attack-path).
- Apply remediations by:
  - Updating Kubernetes configurations
  - Rebuilding vulnerable images
  - Applying Azure Policy or Gatekeeper constraints
  - Restricting network exposure and access permissions
This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by continuously analyzing the environment for exploitable paths and enabling proactive remediation to reduce the blast radius of potential attacks.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without using Cloud Security Explorer, critical attack paths and misconfigurations may go undetected, increasing the risk of lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exposure.
