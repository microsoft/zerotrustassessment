# Enable File Integrity Monitoring

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must ensure Defender for Servers Plan 2 is enabled, validate agent versions, and configure monitoring settings per environment.

**User Impact:** Low  
File integrity monitoring is managed by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

**File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** in Microsoft Defender for Servers helps detect unauthorized changes to critical files, system registries, and application configurations. It is a key capability for identifying potential attacks or policy violations in both Windows and Linux environments.

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** must be enabled.
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent** must be installed via Defender for Servers extensions.
- **Non-Azure machines** must be connected using **Azure Arc**.
- Required permissions: **Workspace Owner** or **Security Admin** to enable/disable FIM; **Reader** to view results [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-defender-endpoint).

### Supported Platforms and Agent Versions

- **Windows**: Minimum version 10.8760 (Windows Server 2016/2019/2022)
- **Linux**: Minimum version 30.124082
- Agent updates are automatic if autoprovisioning is enabled; otherwise, manual updates may be required [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-defender-endpoint).

### How to Enable File Integrity Monitoring

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**.
2. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**.
3. Select the relevant **subscription**.
4. Under **Defender for Servers**, click **Settings**.
5. In the **File Integrity Monitoring** section, toggle the switch to **On**.
6. Click **Edit configuration**:
   - Select a **Log Analytics workspace** to store monitoring data.
   - Choose which **Windows registry keys**, **Windows files**, and **Linux files** to monitor [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/file-integrity-monitoring-enable-defender-endpoint).

### Migration Note

If you're using legacy agents like **Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)** or **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**, migration to the new FIM experience is required. Defender for Servers Plan 2 and the Defender for Endpoint agent are mandatory for the updated FIM [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/migrate-file-integrity-monitoring).

Failing to enable FIM can result in undetected tampering of critical system files, increasing the risk of persistent threats. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring visibility into unauthorized changes across server workloads.
