# Automate Agents Deployment

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Automating agent deployment requires scripting or using infrastructure-as-code tools (like ARM templates or Terraform), and coordination with DevOps or platform engineering teams.

**User Impact:** Low  
This is a backend automation task handled by security and infrastructure teams; end users are not impacted.

## Overview

Automating the deployment of agents in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** ensures consistent and scalable rollout of security components across Kubernetes clusters in Azure, AWS, GCP, and hybrid environments. Defender for Containers uses sensor-based components to enable runtime threat detection, audit log collection, and security posture monitoring.

Automation options include:

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates**
- **REST APIs**
- **Azure Policy initiatives**
- **CI/CD pipeline integration**

These methods allow organizations to:

- Ensure all clusters are onboarded with the required sensors.
- Detect and remediate missing agents at scale.
- Maintain consistent security posture across environments.

This supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that all container environments are continuously monitored and protected through automated, repeatable deployments.

**Risks if not implemented:** Manual deployment increases the risk of misconfigurations, inconsistent coverage, and unmonitored workloads, which can lead to undetected threats and compliance issues.
