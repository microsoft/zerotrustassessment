# Review & Remediate Kubernetes Data Plane Hardening Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
This task involves enabling Azure Policy for Kubernetes, reviewing hardening recommendations, and coordinating with platform teams to apply configuration changes across clusters.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only infrastructure and security teams are involved in the remediation process; end users are not affected.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Containers includes a set of **Kubernetes data plane hardening recommendations** that help secure the runtime environment of Kubernetes clusters. These recommendations are based on best practices and are enforced through **Azure Policy for Kubernetes**, which can be applied to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Arc-enabled clusters, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.

To review and remediate data plane hardening issues:

- Ensure **Azure Policy for Kubernetes** is enabled in Defender for Containers settings.
- Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
- Review the list of Kubernetes data plane hardening recommendations, such as:
  - Disabling privileged containers
  - Enforcing read-only root file systems
  - Restricting hostPath volumes
  - Limiting container capabilities
- Apply remediations by:
  - Updating Kubernetes manifests
  - Applying policy constraints via Azure Policy or Gatekeeper
  - Re-deploying workloads with secure configurations

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Use Least Privilege Access"** by enforcing strict runtime controls and minimizing the attack surface of containerized workloads.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without data plane hardening, Kubernetes clusters may allow insecure configurations that can be exploited for container escapes, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the cluster.
