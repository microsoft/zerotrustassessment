# Deploy Azure Arc

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must plan and execute onboarding of non-Azure machines using Azure Arc, including identity setup, agent installation, and policy configuration.

**User Impact:** Low  
Deployment is handled by administrators; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

**Azure Arc** enables organizations to extend Azure management and security capabilities—including Microsoft Defender for Servers—to **on-premises**, **AWS**, and **GCP** machines. By connecting these machines as **Azure Arc-enabled servers**, Defender for Cloud can apply consistent threat protection, compliance policies, and monitoring across hybrid and multicloud environments.

### Key Capabilities

- Enables **Defender for Servers** protection on non-Azure machines.
- Supports **policy-based governance**, **guest configuration**, and **update management**.
- Integrates with **Azure Monitor**, **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, and **Log Analytics**.

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with **Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2** enabled.
- Machines must run supported versions of Windows or Linux.
- Outbound internet access or proxy configuration for Azure Arc agent communication.
- Permissions to register the Azure Arc resource provider and assign roles.

### How to Deploy Azure Arc

#### For a Single Machine

1. Follow the **Quickstart** guide to connect a hybrid machine:
   - [Quickstart: Connect hybrid machines with Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-machines) [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-machines)
2. Download and run the onboarding script provided in the Azure portal.
3. Verify the machine appears in **Azure Arc > Servers**.

#### For Multiple Machines (At Scale)

1. Use **Azure Policy**, **PowerShell**, or **System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)** to deploy the Azure Arc agent.
2. Automate onboarding using:
   - **Service Principal** or **Managed Identity**
   - **Custom scripts** or **Azure Automation**
3. Reference the full deployment guide:
   - [Plan and deploy Azure Arc-enabled servers at scale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/plan-at-scale-deployment) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/plan-at-scale-deployment)

### Post-Deployment

- Enable **Defender for Servers** on the Arc-enabled machines.
- Configure **guest configuration**, **update management**, and **vulnerability scanning**.
- Monitor compliance and threat alerts in **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

Failing to deploy Azure Arc for non-Azure machines limits visibility and protection across hybrid environments. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring all workloads are onboarded and continuously monitored.
