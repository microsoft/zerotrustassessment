# Determine Response Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must define incident response workflows and integrate alert handling across cloud and hybrid environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators and security teams; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Determining a response strategy in Microsoft Defender for Databases involves planning how your organization will detect, triage, and respond to threats targeting database workloads. Defender for Databases provides real-time threat detection and multicloud alerts for suspicious activities such as SQL injection, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access attempts [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-databases-plan) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-overview).

### Key Components of a Response Strategy

1. **Enable Threat Detection**  
   - Ensure the **Defender for Databases** plan is enabled for all relevant environments (Azure, AWS, GCP).  
   - This activates real-time monitoring and alerting for supported database types [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-databases-plan).

2. **Centralize Incident Management**  
   - Use the **Microsoft Defender portal** to manage incidents.  
   - Group related alerts into incidents, assign owners, and track resolution status [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

3. **Prioritize Alerts**  
   - Classify alerts based on severity, asset sensitivity, and exposure.  
   - Use built-in analytics to identify high-risk incidents that require immediate action [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

4. **Define Remediation Workflows**  
   - Establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for common threats (e.g., disable compromised accounts, block IPs, patch vulnerable systems).  
   - Integrate with tools like Microsoft Sentinel or Logic Apps for automated response.

5. **Post-Incident Review**  
   - After resolving an incident, conduct a root cause analysis.  
   - Update detection rules, access policies, and training based on lessons learned [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/plan-incident-response).

This strategy supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that threats are not only detected but also responded to quickly and effectively. Without a defined response strategy, alerts may go uninvestigated, increasing the risk of data compromise.
