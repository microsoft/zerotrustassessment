# Plan a Lifecycle Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams must define onboarding, monitoring, and offboarding processes for database protection across Azure and multicloud environments.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are performed by administrators; no user-facing changes or notifications are required.

## Overview

Planning a lifecycle strategy in Microsoft Defender for Databases ensures that database security is maintained consistently from deployment to decommissioning. This includes onboarding new database resources, continuously monitoring for threats, and offboarding or reconfiguring protection when databases are retired or migrated.

### Lifecycle Phases

1. **Onboarding**  
   - Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on the Azure subscription.  
   - Connect AWS and GCP environments if applicable.  
   - Enable the **Databases plan**, which activates protection for:
     - Azure SQL Databases  
     - SQL Servers on Machines  
     - Open-Source Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)  
     - Azure Cosmos DB [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-databases-plan)

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**  
   - Use Defender for Cloud dashboards to monitor alerts and recommendations.  
   - Regularly review resource health and coverage to ensure all databases remain protected [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-overview).  
   - Update sensitivity settings and remediation logic as needed.

3. **Scaling and Optimization**  
   - Adjust Defender plans based on workload changes or cost considerations.  
   - Use automation (e.g., Azure Policy, Logic Apps) to streamline onboarding and remediation.

4. **Offboarding and Decommissioning**  
   - When databases are retired, ensure Defender plans are disabled to avoid unnecessary charges.  
   - Archive security logs and alerts for compliance and audit purposes.

This lifecycle strategy supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring continuous protection and visibility throughout the database's operational life. Without a defined lifecycle approach, organizations risk inconsistent coverage, unmanaged costs, and exposure to threats during transitions.
