# Determine Response Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Developing a response strategy requires coordination between security operations, DevOps, and platform teams to define workflows, configure tools, and align with incident response plans.

**User Impact:** Low  
This is a backend security operations task; end users are not directly involved or impacted.

## Overview

A well-defined response strategy in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** enables security teams to detect, investigate, and respond to container-based threats across Kubernetes environments such as AKS, EKS, and GKE. Defender integrates with the **Microsoft Defender portal**, providing real-time alerts, automated response actions, and threat intelligence to support rapid incident handling.

Key components of a response strategy include:

- **Real-time alerting**: Defender for Containers generates alerts for suspicious activity, such as privilege escalation, exposed secrets, or anomalous behavior.
- **Automated response actions**: Security analysts can isolate or terminate compromised pods directly from the Defender portal.
- **Incident graph and attack paths**: Analysts can visualize the full scope of an attack and identify lateral movement paths to prevent further compromise.
- **Threat analytics**: Provides intelligence on active campaigns, threat actors, and container-specific attack techniques to guide response decisions.
- **Advanced hunting**: Enables SOC teams to query logs and correlate events across containers and cloud infrastructure.

This strategy supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling proactive detection and containment of threats, minimizing the impact of potential attacks.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without a defined response strategy, container threats may go undetected or unresolved, increasing the risk of lateral movement, data exfiltration, and prolonged dwell time by attackers.
