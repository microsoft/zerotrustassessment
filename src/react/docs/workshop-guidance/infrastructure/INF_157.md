# Real-time Monitoring and Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Setting up real-time monitoring and response requires integration with SIEM tools, configuring alert rules, and aligning with incident response workflows.

**User Impact:** Low  
All actions are handled by security operations and platform teams; no direct user involvement is required.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for APIs provides **real-time monitoring and response** capabilities for APIs published through **Azure API Management**. It uses a combination of **machine learning** and **rule-based analytics** to detect threats such as those listed in the **OWASP API Top 10**, including broken authentication, excessive data exposure, and injection attacks [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).

### Key Capabilities

- **Runtime Threat Detection**: Defender for APIs ingests live API traffic and analyzes it for anomalies and known attack patterns [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).
- **Alerting**: Security alerts are generated in real time and can be viewed in the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** dashboard or forwarded to SIEM platforms like **Microsoft Sentinel** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).
- **SIEM Integration**: Defender for APIs integrates with existing security operations workflows, enabling centralized investigation and response [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).
- **API Endpoint Monitoring**: Each API endpoint is monitored for authentication status, usage activity, and exposure to the internet [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).
- **Inactive API Detection**: Endpoints with no traffic for 30+ days are flagged as inactive, helping reduce unnecessary attack surface [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction).

### Response Actions

- Investigate alerts in Defender for Cloud or Sentinel.
- Trigger automated playbooks using SOAR tools or Power Automate.
- Disable or reconfigure vulnerable API endpoints.
- Update policies in Azure API Management to enforce authentication or rate limiting.

Without real-time monitoring and response, threats may go undetected until after exploitation. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"** by enabling continuous detection and rapid response to API threats.
