# Evaluate Secure Score

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Evaluating secure score requires regular review by security teams and integration into posture management and compliance workflows.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a monitoring and analysis activity handled by administrators and security leads; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Evaluating the **Secure Score** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps organizations understand and improve their cloud security posture. The secure score aggregates security findings into a single percentage-based metric, calculated based on compliance with the **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)**. A higher score indicates a lower level of risk.

Key aspects of secure score evaluation include:

- **Score Breakdown**: Viewable by environment (Azure, AWS, GCP, Azure DevOps), subscription, and control category.
- **Calculation Frequency**: Each control is recalculated every 8 hours per Azure subscription or cloud connector [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls).
- **Scope**: Only built-in recommendations from the MCSB affect the score. Preview recommendations are excluded but should still be remediated [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls).
- **Drill-Down Capability**: Security teams can explore unhealthy resources and recommendations contributing to the score [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-access-and-track).

The secure score is accessible via the **Defender for Cloud Overview dashboard** and can be used to track progress over time, prioritize remediation, and benchmark against organizational goals.

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by continuously assessing the security posture of cloud environments and providing actionable insights to reduce risk.
