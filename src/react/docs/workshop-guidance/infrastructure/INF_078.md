# Build Remediation Logic

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Creating remediation logic involves downloading and customizing scripts, integrating them into CI/CD or operational workflows, and coordinating with DevOps or platform teams.

**User Impact:** Low  
Only security and DevOps teams are involved in implementing remediation logic; end users are not affected.

## Overview

Building remediation logic in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** allows security teams to automate the response to container-related vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Defender for Cloud provides **remediation scripts** that can be downloaded and executed directly on Kubernetes clusters to address specific security recommendations.

Key steps include:

- Navigating to the relevant recommendation in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Selecting **Download remediation logic** to obtain a pre-generated script.
- Running the script on the affected Kubernetes cluster.
- Optionally integrating the logic into CI/CD pipelines or GitOps workflows for continuous enforcement [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable).

This process supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Use Least Privilege Access"** by ensuring that only authorized and validated remediation actions are applied, reducing the attack surface and enforcing secure configurations.

**Risks if not implemented:** Without remediation logic, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations may persist longer, increasing the risk of exploitation and reducing the effectiveness of your container security posture.
