# Review & Remediate Security Baseline Recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must review OS-level misconfigurations, validate guest configuration deployment, and remediate findings based on Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) baselines.

**User Impact:** Low  
Security baseline remediation is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Servers continuously assesses virtual machines against **security baselines** defined by the **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)**. These baselines help ensure that operating system configurations align with best practices for security and compliance. When deviations are detected, Defender for Cloud generates **recommendations** to guide remediation.

### Prerequisites

- **Defender for Servers Plan 2** must be enabled.
- The **Azure Policy machine configuration extension** (formerly Guest Configuration) must be installed on the VM.
- Machines must not be using the deprecated **Log Analytics agent (MMA)** to avoid duplicate recommendations [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/apply-security-baseline).

### How to Review Security Baseline Recommendations

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
2. Look for:
   - *"Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Windows machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)"*
   - *"Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Linux machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)"*
3. Select the recommendation to view:
   - Affected resources
   - Specific misconfigurations
   - Remediation guidance [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/apply-security-baseline)

### How to Remediate

- Follow the **Remediation steps** provided in the recommendation details.
- Use **Azure Resource Graph** queries to identify and track misconfigurations at scale.
- Apply configuration changes manually or via automation (e.g., Azure Policy, PowerShell, or configuration management tools) [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/apply-security-baseline).

### Additional Tools

- **Azure Resource Graph**: Query and export baseline compliance data.
- **Security Exposure Management**: Centralized view of recommendations across Defender for Cloud and Defender Vulnerability Management [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-exposure-management/security-recommendations).

Failing to remediate baseline misconfigurations can result in non-compliance and increased exposure to attacks. This capability supports the **"Verify Explicitly"** and **"Assume Breach"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring all systems are hardened and continuously monitored.
