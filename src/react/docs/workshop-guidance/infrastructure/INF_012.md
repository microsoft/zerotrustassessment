# Monitor and Manage Tasks

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – This requires configuration of monitoring tools, dashboards, and possibly automation workflows by security and operations teams.

**User Impact:** Low – This is an administrative and operational activity; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Monitoring and managing tasks in Microsoft Defender for Cloud ensures that security recommendations, alerts, and compliance issues are actively tracked and addressed. Administrators can use the **Defender for Cloud dashboard**, **Log Analytics**, and **governance reports** to monitor the status of remediation tasks, track overdue items, and ensure accountability across teams.

Key capabilities include:

- **Governance Reports**: Track remediation progress by owner, subscription, or recommendation.
- **Workflow Automation**: Automatically trigger Logic Apps based on alerts, recommendations, or compliance changes [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/workflow-automation).
- **Log Analytics Integration**: Monitor task status and trends over time using custom queries and dashboards [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/perform-basic-azure-management-tasks/).

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that identified risks are not only surfaced but also actively managed and resolved through structured workflows and oversight.
