# Determine Multicloud Dependencies

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must onboard AWS and GCP environments, configure connectors, and choose the right Defender for Servers plan and deployment method (agent-based or agentless).

**User Impact:** Low  
Multicloud dependency setup is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

When planning to protect server workloads across Azure, AWS, and GCP, it's essential to understand the **multicloud dependencies** required by Microsoft Defender for Servers. This process ensures that all workloads are properly onboarded and protected using the right tools and configurations.

Key components include:

- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Automatically enabled for AWS and GCP once connectors are onboarded. It provides agentless posture assessments and compliance reporting.
- **Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)**: Requires enabling Defender for Servers to protect EC2 and GCE instances. This can be done using:
  - **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** integration
  - **Agentless scanning**
  - **Azure Arc agent** for hybrid/on-premises workloads

As of August 2024, the **Log Analytics agent (MMA)** and **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** are being phased out. Defender for Servers will rely on MDE and agentless methods going forward [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-multicloud-security-determine-multicloud-dependencies).

Failing to identify and configure these dependencies can result in incomplete protection, missed threat detections, and compliance gaps. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring all server workloads across clouds are continuously monitored and secured.
