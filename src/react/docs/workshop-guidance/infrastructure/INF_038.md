# Setup Multicloud Connectors

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must configure cloud connectors for AWS and GCP, either manually or programmatically, and ensure proper permissions and onboarding of resources.

**User Impact:** Low  
Connector setup is handled by administrators; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

Setting up **multicloud connectors** in Microsoft Defender for Servers enables visibility and protection for workloads running in **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. These connectors allow Defender for Cloud to ingest metadata, assess configurations, and apply Defender for Servers plans to non-Azure machines.

### Supported Environments

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

### Connector Setup Options

1. **Portal-Based Setup**:
   - Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**.
   - Select **Add environment** and choose **AWS** or **GCP**.
   - Follow the guided steps to configure permissions and deploy the connector.

2. **Programmatic Setup**:
   - Use the **Defender for Cloud REST API** to automate connector deployment [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-multicloud-security-automate-connector-deployment).
   - Requires:
     - **CloudFormation templates** for AWS
     - **Cloud Shell scripts** for GCP
   - Templates/scripts vary based on the Defender plans being enabled.

### Key Considerations

- **Permissions**: Ensure the appropriate IAM roles are granted in AWS/GCP to allow Defender for Cloud to access metadata and security configurations.
- **Azure Arc**: For full Defender for Servers capabilities (e.g., vulnerability scanning, endpoint protection), onboard machines as **Azure Arc-enabled servers** [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers).
- **Security Plans**: During connector setup, you can enable **Defender for Servers**, **Defender CSPM**, or both depending on your protection needs [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-multicloud-security-get-started).

Failing to set up multicloud connectors limits visibility into non-Azure workloads and prevents Defender for Servers from applying consistent security policies. This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring all cloud environments are onboarded and monitored.
