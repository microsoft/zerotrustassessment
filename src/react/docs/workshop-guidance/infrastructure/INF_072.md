# Deploy Azure Arc

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires onboarding Kubernetes clusters to Azure Arc and enabling Defender for Containers with appropriate network and policy configurations.

**User Impact:** Low – Deployment is handled by platform and security teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Deploying **Azure Arc** in **Microsoft Defender for Containers** enables security monitoring and protection for **on-premises** and **multicloud Kubernetes clusters**. Azure Arc acts as a bridge, allowing Defender for Containers to extend its capabilities—such as runtime threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and policy enforcement—to clusters outside of Azure.

### Key Steps

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - An active **Azure subscription**.
   - **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** must be enabled on the subscription.
   - Outbound network access to required Microsoft endpoints (e.g., `*.ods.opinsights.azure.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`) must be allowed [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-containers-arc).

2. **Connect Kubernetes Cluster to Azure Arc**:
   - Use the Azure portal or CLI to onboard your Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc.
   - This registers the cluster as a resource in Azure and enables policy and extension management.

3. **Enable Defender for Containers Plan**:
   - In **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**, select your subscription.
   - Toggle the **Containers plan** to **On** and click **Save** [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-containers-arc).

4. **Deploy Defender Sensor**:
   - Navigate to **Defender for Cloud > Recommendations**.
   - Search for **"Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters should have the Defender extension installed"**.
   - Select affected clusters and click **Fix** to deploy the Defender sensor [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-containers-arc).

5. **Optional**: Assign a **custom Log Analytics workspace** using Azure Policy if you prefer not to use the default.

This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by extending consistent security monitoring and policy enforcement to Kubernetes clusters across hybrid and multicloud environments.
