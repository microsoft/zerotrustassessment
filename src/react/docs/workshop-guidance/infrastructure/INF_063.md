# Enable Defender for Containers and DCSPM Plan

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires enabling plans in Microsoft Defender for Cloud and deploying supporting components across cloud environments.

**User Impact:** Low – Configuration is handled by security and platform teams; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

Enabling the **Defender for Containers** and **Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (DCSPM)** plans in **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** provides comprehensive protection for containerized workloads and improves visibility into cloud security posture.

### Defender for Containers

This plan enables runtime threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance monitoring for Kubernetes clusters across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments. To enable it:

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to **Environment settings** and select your subscription or connected cloud account.
3. On the **Defender plans** page, toggle **Defender for Containers** to **On**.
4. Deploy the **Defender sensor** to your Kubernetes clusters using the Azure portal, REST API, Azure CLI, or ARM templates [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-enable) [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-containers-azure).

### Defender CSPM (DCSPM)

This plan enhances cloud security posture management by adding capabilities such as:

- Regulatory compliance tracking
- Cloud security explorer
- Attack path analysis
- Agentless scanning for machines

To enable it:

1. In the same **Defender plans** page, toggle **Defender CSPM** to **On**.
2. Click **Save** to apply the changes [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-cspm-plan).

These plans work together to secure both the infrastructure and workloads, aligning with the **"Assume Breach"** and **"Verify Explicitly"** principles of Zero Trust by ensuring continuous monitoring, threat detection, and posture management across multicloud environments.
