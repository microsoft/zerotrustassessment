# Enable Defender for Servers and DCSPM Plan

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Security and IT teams must evaluate server workloads, onboard cloud and hybrid machines, and enable the appropriate Defender for Servers and DCSPM plans at the subscription or resource level.

**User Impact:** Low  
Enabling these plans is handled by administrators and security teams; end users are not directly involved.

## Overview

To protect server workloads across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments, organizations must enable the **Defender for Servers** and **Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (DCSPM)** plans in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

### Defender for Servers

This plan provides threat protection, vulnerability management, and security posture recommendations for Windows and Linux VMs. It supports:

- **Azure VMs**
- **Azure Arc-enabled servers** (for on-premises and multicloud)
- **AWS EC2 and GCP Compute Engine** (via Arc or agentless onboarding)

There are two plan tiers:

- **Plan 1**: Includes Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration and basic threat detection.
- **Plan 2**: Adds advanced features like file integrity monitoring, just-in-time access, and premium vulnerability management [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-servers-plan).

### DCSPM (Defender CSPM)

DCSPM provides agentless, cloud-native posture management across Azure, AWS, and GCP. It continuously evaluates configurations against security best practices and compliance standards.

### Enabling the Plans

- **Subscription-level enablement** is recommended for broad coverage.
- **Resource-level enablement** is available for more granular control.
- AWS and GCP machines must be connected to Defender for Cloud and onboarded as Azure Arc-enabled VMs [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-servers-plan).

Once enabled, a 30-day trial begins automatically. Proper enablement ensures continuous protection and visibility across all server workloads, supporting the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by proactively securing infrastructure against threats.
