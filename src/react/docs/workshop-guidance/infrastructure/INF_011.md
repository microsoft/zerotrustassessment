# Review Governance Report

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Reviewing governance reports requires configuration of governance rules and regular monitoring by security teams to track remediation progress.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a reporting and oversight activity handled by administrators and security leads; end users are not directly affected.

## Overview

The **Governance Report** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides visibility into how well remediation tasks are being executed across your cloud environments. Once governance rules are defined—assigning owners and due dates to specific security recommendations—the governance report allows you to track the status of these tasks by **subscription**, **recommendation**, or **owner**.

The report shows how many recommendations are:

- **Completed**
- **On time**
- **Overdue**
- **Unassigned**

This enables security teams to follow up on overdue tasks, identify gaps in ownership, and ensure accountability. The governance report supports organizations in maintaining a strong security posture by enforcing SLAs around remediation and surfacing areas that need attention.

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that identified risks are actively tracked and resolved, reducing the window of exposure.
