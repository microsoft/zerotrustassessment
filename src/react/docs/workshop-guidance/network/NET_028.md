# 028: Base SWG: Header Review and Redesign existing Internet Access filtering policies

**Implementation Effort:** Medium 

**User Impact:** Medium 
 
## Overview

In the era of evolving cyber threats and distributed workforces, organizations should move beyond traditional perimeter-based security and adopt Zero Trust principles when managing Internet Access filtering policies. Rather than assuming everything inside the corporate network is trustworthy, Zero Trust mandates that no user or device is inherently trusted—regardless of location.

When reviewing and redesigning existing Internet Access filtering policies, organizations should:

- **Assess Current Policies:** Begin by cataloging and evaluating all existing web filtering rules, understanding what is permitted or blocked, and identifying any legacy exceptions that may introduce risk.
- **Adopt Least Privilege:** Implement access controls that ensure users and devices receive only the minimum Internet access required for their roles. Regularly review and adjust these permissions to reduce exposure.
- **Contextual Access:** Leverage contextual signals such as device health, user identity, location, and risk level to dynamically adjust filtering policies.
- **Continuous Verification:** Ensure that access to Internet resources is continuously monitored and validated. Use advanced threat intelligence and behavioral analytics for real-time enforcement.
- **Segmentation:** Apply granular segmentation to control access to sensitive resources and restrict lateral movement, even for internal users.
- **Automated Enforcement:** Employ policy automation and orchestration to rapidly adapt to emerging threats and organizational changes.
