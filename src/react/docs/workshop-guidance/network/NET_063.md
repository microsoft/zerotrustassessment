 # Centralize Azure Firewall deployment for inter-VNet traffic inspection.

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview

Deploy Azure Firewall as the centralized segmentation and inspection enforcement point by provisioning it in the *AzureFirewallSubnet* of your Hub VNet. In a hub-spoke topology, all spoke VNets route traffic through the hub, ensuring your segmentation boundaries are consistently enforced. Configure user-defined routes (UDRs) in each spoke subnet’s route table to direct north–south (0.0.0.0/0) and east–west (spoke CIDRs) traffic to the firewall’s private IP address. Azure Firewall then enforces those segmentation policies, inspects and logs traffic, and filters packets according to your network and application rule collections—preventing lateral movement and unauthorized access across your environment.
