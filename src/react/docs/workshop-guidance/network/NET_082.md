#  Azure WAF on Azure Application Gateway  to protect regional and internal applications

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

After associating your WAF policy with Front Door or Application Gateway, enable the Default Rule Set (DRS) 2.1 to block OWASP Top Ten threats and vulnerabilities — such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and path traversal attacks. Assign the Bot Manager 1.1 rule group to detect malicious bot traffic. 

Monitor WAF logs in Azure Monitor or built-in workbooks to identify false positives and refine your exclusions or overrides per best practices. Once you’ve validated your tuning—using guidance for Front Door tuning and Application Gateway best practices—you can switch your log action to Prevention mode to actively block malicious requests.

These managed rule groups are available for both Azure Front Door and Application Gateway, ensuring consistent, automated defenses across your global and regional WAF deployments.
