**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low


## Overview

Use Azure Policy to enforce consistent WAF deployment by assigning built-in definitions—such as “Web Application Firewall should be enabled for Azure Front Door” and “Web Application Firewall should be enabled for Application Gateway”—to audit or automatically deploy missing WAF policies at scale. 

Enable Diagnostic Settings on each Front Door and Application Gateway to stream WAF logs into a central Log Analytics workspace 

In Azure Monitor, create Log Alert in your WAF logs—and route notifications to Action Groups, Logic Apps, or Azure Functions to automate incident workflows. 

Finally, ingest these diagnostics into Microsoft Sentinel via the Azure WAF connector, author Sentinel analytics rules to generate incidents on suspicious behavior, and leverage playbooks to streamline investigation and remediation—ensuring continuous governance of your WAF controls.
