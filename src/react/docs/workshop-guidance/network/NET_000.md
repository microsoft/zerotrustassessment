# 000: Overview Network Pillar

**Implementation Effort:** High

**User Impact:** High

## Overview
Network security changed a lot in recent years. Instead of relying on a single perimeter, organizations now use risk-based policies to control both internal and external traffic. 
This means isolating hosts, enforcing encryption, segmenting networks, and improving visibility across the enterprise. Security controls are now placed closer to applications and data, 
making it easier to protect resources and respond to threats. Each application can have its own security settings based on its specific needs for access and connectivity.

### Key Principles of the Zero Trust Network Model
Instead of assuming that everything behind the corporate firewall is secure, an end-to-end Zero Trust strategy acknowledges that breaches are inevitable. 
This approach requires verifying each request as if it originates from an uncontrolled network, with identity management playing a crucial role. 
When organizations incorporate the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Zero Trust models and patterns, they enhance their security posture and better protect their networks.

To make this happen, follow three Zero Trust principles:

- Verify explicitly. Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. Include user identity, location, device health, service or workload, user and device risk, data classification, and anomalies.
- Use least-privileged access. Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
- Assume breach. Minimize influence radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and application awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end to end. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

Zero Trust (ZT) is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request. The Network Pillar in Zero Trust focuses on securing communications, segmenting environments, and enforcing least privilege access to resources.
