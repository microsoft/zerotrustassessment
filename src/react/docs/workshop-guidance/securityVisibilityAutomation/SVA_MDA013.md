# Create Defender for Cloud Apps anomaly detection policies

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure and manage the anomaly detection policies effectively.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users may need to be notified of changes or actions required based on the alerts generated by the anomaly detection policies.

## Overview
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps anomaly detection policies provide advanced threat detection using user and entity behavioral analytics (UEBA) and machine learning (ML). These policies help identify and mitigate threats by analyzing user activities and comparing them to a learned baseline, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by continuously monitoring and securing cloud environments.
