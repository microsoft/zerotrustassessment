# 025: Protect Critical Assets

## Overview

Implement the classifiers or labels required to detect the critical data assets identified in the previous step. 
* Fingerprint the document for which that is the optimal detection method and associate the fingerprints with classifiers.  
* Label and protect assets where that's the best method for identification. Include usage restrictions (do not copy, do not print, do not export, etc.) in the labels used for such assets, as well as dynamic watermarks where appropriate. 

Special Cryptographic methods are addressed as a separate step.
