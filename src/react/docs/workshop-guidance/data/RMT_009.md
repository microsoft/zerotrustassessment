# Implement label recommendations

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** High - Only if you haven't included this in the user training, otherwise this is a low impact activity.

## Overview

Configure label recommendation in client-side labeling for the group of pilot users. 
After a period of a few weeks, evaluate using Activity Explorer and Autolabeling simulations whether the recommendations were accepted and applied by users to assess and fine-tune accuracy of the rules.
