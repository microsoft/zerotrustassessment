# Automatically label sensitive assets

**Implementation Effort:** Low

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Configure client-side Auto-labeling rules in automatic application mode (either as replacement or in addition to label recommendations as implemented previously) for the group of pilot users. Configure service-side auto-labeling for SharePoint Online, OneDrive and Exchange users. 
Client-side autolabeling, being interactive, can be more aggressive in the use of classifiers with low confidence (users are allowed to override the application of a label to the content they are creating). Service-side autolabeling occurs without user interaction, so it is generally limited to rules with higher certainty (e.g. higher match count and/or higher SIT confidence levels).

Monitor using activity explorer or a SIEM tool to see if users are overriding labels that were applied automatically and adjust the policies or further train users if needed.
