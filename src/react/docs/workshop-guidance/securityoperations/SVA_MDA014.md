# Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps - EntraID Identity Protection integration and reporting

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Implementing visibility and control over cloud apps requires ongoing monitoring, configuration, and management by IT and Security Operations teams.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users may need to take action or be notified of changes, particularly when unsanctioned apps are blocked or when session controls are enforced.

## Overview
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps provides comprehensive visibility and control over data travel and sophisticated analytics to identify and combat cyber threats across Microsoft and third-party cloud services. Integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, it enables real-time protection through Conditional Access App Control, helping organizations manage shadow IT and enforce access controls based on user, app, and network conditions.
