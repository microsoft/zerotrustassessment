# View the Cloud Discovery dashboard to see what apps are being used in your organization

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to set up and configure the Cloud Discovery dashboard and manage ongoing monitoring and filtering of apps.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as department heads or team leaders, may need to take action or be notified of changes regarding app usage and risks.

## Overview
The Cloud Discovery dashboard in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps provides insights into how cloud apps are being used within an organization. It offers a high-level overview of app types, usage, risk levels, and top users, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by enabling continuous monitoring and management of app-related risks.
