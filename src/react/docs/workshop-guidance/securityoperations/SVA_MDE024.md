# Prioritize vulnerability remediation with attack paths

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to integrate and analyze data sources for attack path visualization.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users, such as IT staff and security analysts, may need to take action or be notified of changes.

## Overview
Attack paths in Microsoft Security Exposure Management help you proactively identify and visualize potential routes that attackers can exploit using vulnerabilities, gaps, and misconfigurations. Simulated attack paths allow you to investigate and remediate potential threats, enhancing your organization's security posture.
