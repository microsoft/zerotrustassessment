# Enable Cloud Protection

**Implementation Effort:** **Low** – This is a straightforward configuration that can be deployed quickly using Group Policy, Intune, or other endpoint management tools.

**User Impact:** **High** – While the setting is applied by admins, enabling cloud protection can trigger real-time threat responses, file blocking, and sample submissions that may affect a wide range of users. Users may also need to be informed about changes in behavior (e.g., files being blocked or quarantined more aggressively).

## Overview

Cloud protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus connects endpoints to Microsoft’s cloud-based threat intelligence service, enabling faster and more accurate detection of malware and suspicious behavior. It powers features like **Block at First Sight**, **automatic sample submission**, and **cloud-delivered heuristics**, which are essential for defending against zero-day threats and polymorphic malware. This capability is foundational for organizations using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as many advanced detection and response features depend on cloud connectivity.

Failing to enable cloud protection significantly weakens an organization’s ability to detect and respond to emerging threats in real time. This increases dwell time for attackers and reduces the effectiveness of automated investigation and remediation. Enabling cloud protection aligns with the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring endpoints are continuously evaluated against the latest threat intelligence and behavioral analytics.
