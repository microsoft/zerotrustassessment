Device discovery in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint helps security teams identify unmanaged or unknown devices on the network. It can be enabled in **Basic mode** (passive listening) or **Standard mode** (active probing), depending on the level of visibility needed. Basic mode is quick to enable and provides immediate insights with minimal configuration. This feature is essential for identifying shadow IT and unmanaged endpoints that may not be protected or monitored.

It supports the **Zero Trust principle of “Assume Breach”** by ensuring visibility into all devices, reducing the risk of blind spots that attackers could exploit. Without device discovery, organizations may unknowingly leave parts of their network exposed to threats.
