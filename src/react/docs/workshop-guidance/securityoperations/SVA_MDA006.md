# Regulate apps with priority account consent

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to set up and customize app governance policies based on organizational needs.

**User Impact:** High: Non-privileged users may need to take action or be notified of changes, especially if their apps are flagged for compliance issues.

## Overview
App governance policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps enable organizations to specify conditions for alerting and remediating app behavior automatically or manually. These policies help enforce app compliance and manage OAuth apps connected to services like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring only compliant and secure apps are used within the organization.
