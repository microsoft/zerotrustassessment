# Set up Safe Links policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure and manage Safe Links policies, including setting up permissions and using the Microsoft Defender portal or Exchange Online PowerShell.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users may need to take action or be notified of changes, especially if specific Safe Links policies are applied to certain users, groups, or domains.

## Overview
Safe Links in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides URL scanning of links in messages, Microsoft Teams, and supported Office 365 apps to protect against malicious links. This feature is essential for maintaining a secure environment by ensuring that links are safe before users click on them, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by continuously verifying the safety of URLs.
