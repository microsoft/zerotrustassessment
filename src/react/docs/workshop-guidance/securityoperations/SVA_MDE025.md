# Prioritize Actions to Improve Your Endpoint Security Posture Based on Risk and Impact

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Security and IT teams must drive ongoing review and improvement projects using prioritized recommendations from Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Security Exposure Management, but these do not require broad operational restructuring.  
**User Impact:** Low — Actions are taken by administrators; end users generally do not need to make changes or be notified.

## Overview
This capability focuses on helping security teams understand which endpoint security issues pose the highest risk and which actions will have the greatest impact on reducing exposure. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides prioritized improvement actions through tools such as Secure Score, while **Microsoft Security Exposure Management (MSEM)** adds deeper context by identifying critical assets, attack paths, misconfigurations, exposed secrets, and vulnerabilities. MSEM surfaces a **prioritized list of remediation actions**, enabling teams to focus their limited resources where they will reduce the most risk.  
If this activity is not done, organizations may apply effort to low‑impact tasks, leaving high-risk gaps open and increasing the likelihood of successful attacks.

This aligns with the **Assume Breach** Zero Trust principle by using analytics and continuous assessment to reduce exposure, strengthen defenses, and limit potential attacker impact.
