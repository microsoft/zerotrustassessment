# Streamline Data Analysis with UEBA in Microsoft Sentinel

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Enabling UEBA in Microsoft Sentinel requires configuring data connectors, ensuring proper log ingestion, and tuning analytics rules, which involves a project-driven effort by IT and security teams.

**User Impact:** Low – UEBA operates in the background and is used by security analysts; end users are not directly impacted or required to take action.

## Overview

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel enhances threat detection by analyzing behavioral patterns of users, devices, and other entities across your environment. It builds baselines using machine learning and identifies anomalies that may indicate insider threats, compromised accounts, or advanced persistent threats. UEBA reduces the manual effort of sifting through alerts by providing enriched, high-fidelity insights that help analysts prioritize and investigate incidents more effectively.

UEBA supports Zero Trust by aligning with the **"Assume Breach"** principle—continuously monitoring for abnormal behavior and potential compromise, even from internal actors. Without UEBA, organizations risk missing subtle or sophisticated threats that evade traditional rule-based detection, leading to delayed response and greater damage.
