# Enable App Governance

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Enabling app governance primarily involves activating a feature in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal and does not require a large project or ongoing resource commitment.

**User Impact:** Low  
App governance operates in the background and is managed by administrators; end users are not directly impacted or required to take action.

## Overview

App governance is a security and policy management capability within Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps that provides visibility and control over OAuth-enabled third-party apps connected to Microsoft 365. It helps detect risky app behaviors, enforce policy-based controls, and remediate threats such as over-permissioned or malicious apps. Enabling app governance involves verifying licensing, assigning appropriate admin roles, and activating the feature in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal. If not enabled, organizations risk blind spots in app behavior, which can lead to data exposure or compliance violations. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"assume breach"** by continuously monitoring app behavior and enforcing governance to reduce the attack surface.
