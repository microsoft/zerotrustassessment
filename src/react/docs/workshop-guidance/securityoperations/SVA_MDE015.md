# Device control in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure and manage device control policies using tools like Intune.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users have to take action or be notified of changes, especially those using peripheral devices.

## Overview
Device control capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint enable your security team to control whether users can install and use peripheral devices, like removable storage, printers, Bluetooth devices, or other devices with their computers. This helps protect your organization from potential data loss, malware, or other cyberthreats by allowing or preventing certain devices to be connected to users' computers.
