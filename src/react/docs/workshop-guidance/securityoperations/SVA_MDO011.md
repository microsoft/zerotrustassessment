# User reported settings - Microsoft Defender for Office 365

**Implementation Effort:** High: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to implement programs that require ongoing time or resource commitment to configure and manage user reporting settings effectively.

**User Impact:** High: A large number of non-privileged users have to take action or be notified of changes, as they will be responsible for reporting suspicious messages.

## Overview
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 allows organizations to configure user reporting settings for malicious or non-malicious messages in Outlook. Admins can decide whether reported messages go to an internal reporting mailbox, to Microsoft, or both, enhancing the organization's ability to manage and analyze reported messages effectively within the Zero Trust framework.
