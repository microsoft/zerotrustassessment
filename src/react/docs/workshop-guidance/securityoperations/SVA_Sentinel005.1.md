# Enable Unified Security Operations Platform

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
This version assumes the organization is already licensed and onboarded to Microsoft Defender XDR and Sentinel, and only needs to enable the unified portal experience via configuration toggles.

**User Impact:** Low  
No end-user involvement is required; changes are limited to the security operations teamâ€™s tools and workflows.

## Overview

Enabling the **Unified Security Operations Platform** in Microsoft Defender allows security teams to access Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Sentinel, and other tools from a single portal. This streamlines threat detection, investigation, and response by consolidating telemetry and alerts across endpoints, identities, cloud, and email.

This action supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by improving visibility and correlation across the attack surface. If not enabled, security teams may face inefficiencies due to switching between portals, slower incident response, and missed threat correlations.
