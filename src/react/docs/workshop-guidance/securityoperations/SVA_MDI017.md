**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to classify and manage critical assets using predefined and custom classifications.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as IT staff, need to take action or be notified of changes in asset classifications.

## Overview
Microsoft Security Exposure Management helps organizations keep their critical assets secure and available by allowing them to review and classify these assets. This involves using predefined and custom classifications to manage devices, identities, and cloud resources, ensuring they are protected against risks such as data breaches and operational disruptions.
