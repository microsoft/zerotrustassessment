# Connect Apps to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Implementation Effort:** High  
Connecting apps to MDA requires IT and Security teams to configure and maintain API connectors, manage permissions, monitor syncs, and ensure ongoing governance, which demands sustained operational and resource commitment.

**User Impact:** Medium  
While end users are not directly involved in setup, a subset may be affected by policy enforcement, access restrictions, or alerts triggered by app activity monitoring.

## Overview

Connecting apps to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDA)** allows organizations to gain deep visibility and control over third-party SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Box, Google Workspace, and others. This is done through **API connectors**, which use the app provider’s APIs to extract data about users, files, activities, and configurations. Once connected, MDA can apply governance actions, detect threats, and enforce compliance policies across these apps.

The process involves granting system admin-level permissions to MDA, which then performs an initial scan of users, groups, files, and activities. This scan can take time depending on the size of the tenant and the app. After the initial sync, MDA continues to monitor the app periodically. Multi-instance support is available for some apps, allowing separate configurations for different business units.

Failing to connect critical apps to MDA leaves blind spots in cloud security posture, increasing the risk of data exfiltration, shadow IT, and undetected threats.

This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of “Assume Breach”** by enabling continuous monitoring and control over third-party cloud services, ensuring that even trusted apps are not exempt from scrutiny.
