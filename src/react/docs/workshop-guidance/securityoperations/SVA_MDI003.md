# Configure sensors for AD FS, AD CS, and Microsoft Entra Connect

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Installing and configuring sensors across multiple services (AD FS, AD CS, Microsoft Entra Connect) requires significant planning, coordination, and ongoing management by IT and Security Operations teams.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, particularly those using AD FS, AD CS, and Microsoft Entra Connect services, may need to be notified of changes or take action.

## Overview
This documentation provides detailed steps for installing Microsoft Defender for Identity sensors on Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), and Microsoft Entra Connect servers. These sensors help protect these services from on-premises and hybrid attacks, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring continuous monitoring and threat detection.
