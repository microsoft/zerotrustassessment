# Create and use Microsoft Sentinel automation rules to manage response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Automation rules require IT and Security Operations teams to design, configure, and test rule logic and triggers, but do not require ongoing user programs.

**User Impact:** Low  
Automation rules operate in the background and are managed by administrators; end users are not directly affected or required to take action.

## Overview

Microsoft Sentinel automation rules are a powerful feature that allows security teams to streamline and standardize incident response workflows. These rules can be triggered by specific events—such as the creation or update of incidents or alerts—and can perform a variety of actions like assigning owners, tagging incidents, changing statuses, suppressing noise, or invoking playbooks. By using automation rules, security operations centers (SOCs) can reduce manual effort, improve consistency, and respond faster to threats.

This capability supports the **"Assume breach"** principle of Zero Trust by enabling rapid, consistent, and automated responses to potential threats, minimizing the window of exposure and human error. Not implementing automation rules can lead to slower incident response times, inconsistent handling of alerts, and increased analyst fatigue due to repetitive manual tasks.
