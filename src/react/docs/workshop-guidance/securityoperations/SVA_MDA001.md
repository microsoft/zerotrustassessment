# Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Enabling Defender for Cloud Apps can be done through targeted configuration steps in the Microsoft Defender portal, without requiring a large-scale project or ongoing resource commitment.

**User Impact:** Low  
The feature is implemented and managed by administrators; end users are not required to take action or be notified.

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) that helps organizations gain visibility into cloud app usage, detect threats, and enforce data protection policies. Enabling it involves activating the service in the Microsoft Defender portal, assigning roles, and optionally integrating with Defender for Endpoint or third-party proxies. Once enabled, it provides real-time monitoring, policy enforcement, and threat detection across sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud apps.

This capability supports the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by continuously analyzing cloud activity, detecting anomalies, and enabling automated responses. If not enabled, organizations risk losing visibility into shadow IT, missing early indicators of compromise, and failing to enforce data protection in cloud environments.
