# Remediate risks and unblock users

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to set up risk-based policies and configure self-remediation options.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users have to take action or be notified of changes, such as performing MFA or secure password changes to self-remediate risks.

## Overview
Microsoft Entra ID Protection helps organizations detect, investigate, and remediate identity-based risks. It provides options for automated and manual remediation, including self-remediation by users through risk-based policies and secure password changes. This capability fits into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring that identity risks are continuously monitored and mitigated, maintaining secure access.
