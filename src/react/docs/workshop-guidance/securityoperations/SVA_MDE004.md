**Implementation Effort:** Medium â€“ This task requires IT teams to plan and execute onboarding across multiple device types and platforms using tools like Microsoft Intune, Group Policy, or local scripts.

**User Impact:** Low â€“ The onboarding process is handled by administrators and does not require end-user interaction or behavior changes.

Onboarding devices to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** is the foundational step to enable endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities across your organization. This process involves selecting the appropriate deployment method (e.g., Microsoft Intune, Group Policy, Configuration Manager, or local scripts), downloading the onboarding package, and applying it to supported devices such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Microsoft recommends a **ring-based deployment** strategy to minimize riskâ€”starting with a small group of test devices, then expanding to pilot and full deployment rings.

This onboarding is critical to ensure devices are visible in the Defender portal, can report telemetry, and are protected by real-time threat detection. If not done, devices remain unmonitored, increasing the risk of undetected threats and delayed incident response.

This activity aligns with the **"Assume Breach"** principle of Zero Trust by ensuring all endpoints are monitored and can be isolated or remediated quickly in case of compromise.
