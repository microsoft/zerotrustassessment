# Tune Security Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium - Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure and manage security alerts within Microsoft Defender XDR.

**User Impact:** Low - Action can be taken by administrators, users donâ€™t have to be notified.

## Overview
Microsoft Defender for Identity security alerts are integrated into Microsoft Defender XDR, providing enhanced cross-domain signal enrichment and automated identity response capabilities. This integration helps improve the efficiency of security operations by correlating identity alerts with other Microsoft Defender products, fitting into the Zero Trust framework by ensuring comprehensive monitoring and automated responses to identity threats.
