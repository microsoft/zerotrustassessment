# Creating Microsoft Sentinel custom connectors

**Implementation Effort:** High: Creating custom connectors involves significant development work, including programming and configuration, which requires ongoing time and resource commitment.

**User Impact:** Low: A subset of non-privileged users, such as IT and security teams, need to take action to configure and manage these connectors.

## Overview
Microsoft Sentinel provides various methods for creating custom data connectors to ingest data from sources that do not have dedicated connectors. These methods include using the Log Analytics API, Logstash, Logic Apps, PowerShell, and Azure Functions, each with different capabilities and complexities. Custom connectors are essential for integrating unique data sources into Sentinel, enhancing its ability to monitor and analyze security data within the Zero Trust framework.
