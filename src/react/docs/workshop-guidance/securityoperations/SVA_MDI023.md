# Troubleshoot Known Issues in Microsoft Defender for Identity

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to investigate and resolve deployment or operational issues with Defender for Identity.

**User Impact:** Low  
Action can be taken by administrators; users donâ€™t have to be notified or take action.

## Overview

This documentation outlines how to identify and resolve common issues in Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI), such as sensor installation failures, service startup problems, and domain controller connectivity issues. These problems can prevent MDI from functioning correctly, which may result in missed detections or incomplete visibility into identity-based threats.

If these issues are not addressed, organizations risk losing visibility into suspicious identity behaviors, which could delay detection of lateral movement or credential theft.

This aligns with the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"**, as maintaining a healthy MDI deployment ensures continuous monitoring and threat detection across identity infrastructure.
