**Implementation Effort:** Low: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to configure and manage anti-phishing policies in the Microsoft Defender portal.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users may need to be notified of changes, especially if custom policies are applied to specific users, groups, or domains.

## Overview
Anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provide protection against spoofing and impersonation attacks.
