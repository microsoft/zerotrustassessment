# Enable Application Control

**Implementation Effort:** High: Requires ongoing management and monitoring by IT and Security Operations teams to ensure policies are correctly enforced and updated.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users may need to be informed about changes to application control policies, especially if their workflows are affected by new restrictions.

## Overview
Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature that helps prevent unauthorized applications from running on Windows devices. It is used to enforce application control policies, which are a critical component of the Zero Trust framework, ensuring that only trusted applications can execute.
