# Prepare to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – This deployment requires IT and Security Operations teams to coordinate licensing, tenant setup, network configuration, and onboarding tools, but it does not require ongoing programmatic changes.

**User Impact:** Low – The preparation phase is handled entirely by administrators; end users are not impacted or required to take action.

## Overview

Preparing to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint involves several foundational steps to ensure a secure and functional deployment. These include validating licensing, configuring the Microsoft 365 tenant, ensuring proper network connectivity, and selecting the appropriate onboarding method (e.g., Microsoft Configuration Manager, Group Policy, or Microsoft Intune). The setup also includes assigning roles and permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and verifying data residency requirements.

This preparation is critical to ensure devices can communicate with Defender for Endpoint cloud services and that security teams have the right access to manage and monitor endpoints. Skipping or misconfiguring these steps can lead to failed deployments, incomplete data visibility, or security gaps.

This activity aligns with the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by ensuring that all endpoints are properly onboarded and monitored from the start, reducing the risk of undetected threats.
