# Microsoft Defender for Identity Health Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium. Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to monitor and resolve health issues.

**User Impact:** Low. Actions can be taken by administrators, and users donâ€™t have to be notified.

## Overview
Microsoft Defender for Identity health alerts notify administrators of any current health issues within their Defender for Identity deployment and sensors. These alerts help ensure the security and functionality of the identity protection system by highlighting domain-related or sensor-specific issues. This feature fits into the Zero Trust framework by continuously monitoring and maintaining the integrity of identity protection mechanisms.
