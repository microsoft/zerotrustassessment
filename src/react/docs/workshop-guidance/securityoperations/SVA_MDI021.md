# Understand and investigate Lateral Movement Paths - Microsoft Defender for Identity

**Implementation Effort:** Medium: Customer IT and Security Operations teams need to drive projects to continuously monitor and manage lateral movement paths.

**User Impact:** Medium: A subset of non-privileged users have to take action or be notified of changes, particularly those whose accounts are identified as part of lateral movement paths.

## Overview
Microsoft Defender for Identity helps identify and mitigate lateral movement paths (LMPs) within a network. LMPs are visual guides that show how attackers can move laterally to gain access to sensitive accounts, helping organizations prevent these attacks and protect their sensitive entities.
