# Review Threat Analytics Daily

**Implementation Effort:** Low — This is a targeted daily action performed by security teams using built‑in dashboards and requires no long-term implementation effort.  
**User Impact:** Low — All review work is handled by administrators; end users do not need to take action or be notified.

## Overview
Threat Analytics in Microsoft Defender provides security teams with analyst-written intelligence reports that explain active threats, related attack campaigns, organizational exposure, and recommended defensive actions. It includes details such as threat behavior, mitigation steps, detection guidance, and advanced hunting queries, helping teams stay ahead of emerging risks. Not reviewing Threat Analytics daily can delay awareness of high‑impact threats and result in missing critical mitigations that reduce exposure.  
This capability supports the **Assume Breach** principle by using up-to-date threat intelligence and analytics to identify active risks early and guide rapid defensive response.

### Where to view
You can access Threat Analytics in the Microsoft Defender portal:

- **Microsoft Defender portal → Threat Analytics**  
  Provides visibility into active threats, known impact, and your organization’s exposure.  
- **Threat Analytics → Analyst Reports**  
  Offers detailed information on threat behavior, mitigations, detections, and hunting guidance.
