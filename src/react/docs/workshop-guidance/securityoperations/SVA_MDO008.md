# Create Quarantine Policies

**Implementation Effort:** Medium - Creating and configuring quarantine policies requires project-driven efforts by IT and Security Operations teams. This involves setting up different access levels, permissions, and notification settings 

**User Impact:** Low - A subset of non-privileged users may need to interact with quarantined messages and manage false positive folders based on the policies set 

## Overview
Quarantine policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 allow administrators to define the user experience for quarantined messages, including what actions users can take and whether they receive notifications. These policies can be customized to fit specific organizational needs and are managed through the Microsoft Defender portal or PowerShell. Admins can create custom quarantine policies that define the capabilities for users, including less restrictive or more restrictive actions. Quarantine notifications can be customized and are not turned on by default in certain policies
