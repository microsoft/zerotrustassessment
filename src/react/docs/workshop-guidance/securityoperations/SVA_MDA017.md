# Create policies to control OAuth apps - Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**Implementation Effort:** Low: Creating an OAuth app policy involves configuring settings and permissions within the Microsoft Defender Portal, which requires project-level effort from IT teams.

**User Impact:** Medium: Notifications about new OAuth applications will primarily affect administrators and a subset of users who manage app permissions, requiring them to take action based on the alerts.

## Overview
Creating policies to control OAuth apps in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps allows administrators to set automated notifications for OAuth apps that meet specific criteria. This feature helps in monitoring and managing app permissions, ensuring compliance and security within the Zero Trust framework by alerting administrators to potentially risky applications.
