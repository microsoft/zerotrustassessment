# Automate Threat Responses with Sentinel Playbooks

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Setting up playbooks requires configuring Azure Logic Apps, defining automation rules, and coordinating with SOC processes, but it doesn’t require continuous manual effort once deployed.

**User Impact:** Low – Playbooks are executed by administrators or SOC teams; end users are not directly involved or impacted.

## Overview

Microsoft Sentinel playbooks are automated workflows built using Azure Logic Apps that help security operations teams respond to threats faster and more consistently. These playbooks can be triggered automatically by analytics or automation rules in response to specific alerts or incidents, or they can be run manually during investigations. Common use cases include isolating compromised machines, disabling user accounts, enriching incidents with external data, syncing with ticketing systems like ServiceNow, and notifying teams via Microsoft Teams or Slack.

By automating repetitive and time-sensitive tasks, playbooks reduce manual workload and response time, allowing SOC analysts to focus on complex threats. This capability supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling rapid containment and response to threats, minimizing potential damage.

Failing to implement automated responses can lead to delayed containment of threats, increased manual errors, and slower incident resolution, which increases the risk of lateral movement and data exfiltration.
