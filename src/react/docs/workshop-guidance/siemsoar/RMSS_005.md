# 005: Microsoft Purview

## Overview

 Microsoft Purview provides organizations with visibility into where sensitive information is stored, helping prioritize at-risk data for protection. v

Integrate Microsoft Purview with MicroVsoft Sentinel to help narrow down the high volume of incidents and threats surfaced in Microsoft Sentinel, and understand the most critical areas to start.

Start by ingesting your Microsoft Purview logs into Microsoft Sentinel through a data connector. Then use a Microsoft Sentinel workbook to view data such as assets scanned, classifications found, and labels applied by Microsoft Purview. Use analytics rules to create alerts for changes within data sensitivity.
