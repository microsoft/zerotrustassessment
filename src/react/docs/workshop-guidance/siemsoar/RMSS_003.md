# 003: Microsoft Defender XDR

## Overview

Integrate Microsoft Defender XDR with Microsoft Sentinel to stream all Defender XDR incidents and advanced hunting events into Microsoft Sentinel and keep the incidents and events synchronized between the Azure and Microsoft Defender portals. Incidents from Defender XDR include all associated alerts, entities, and relevant information, providing you with enough context to perform triage and preliminary investigation in Microsoft Sentinel. Once in Microsoft Sentinel, incidents remain bi-directionally synced with Defender XDR, allowing you to take advantage of the benefits of both portals in your incident investigation.
