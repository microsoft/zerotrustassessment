# 004: Connect diagnostic settings to Microsoft Sentinel

## Overview

Microsoft Sentinel uses the Azure foundation to provide built-in, service-to-service support for data ingestion from many Azure and Microsoft 365 services, Amazon Web Services, and various Windows Server services. There are a few different methods through which these connections are made.

Some of these types of connectors are managed by using Azure Policy. For the other connectors of this type, use the standalone instructions.
