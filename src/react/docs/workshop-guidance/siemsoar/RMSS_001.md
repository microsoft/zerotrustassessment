# 001: Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integrated cloud workload protections allow you to detect and quickly respond to threats across hybrid and multicloud workloads.

This connector allows you to ingest security alerts from Defender for Cloud into Microsoft Sentinel, so you can view, analyze, and respond to Defender alerts, and the incidents they generate, in a broader organizational threat context.

As Microsoft Defender for Cloud Defender plans are enabled per subscription, this data connector is also enabled or disabled separately for each subscription.
