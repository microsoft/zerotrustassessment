# 075: Shared iPad

## Overview

1. **Definition and Setup**:
   - Shared iPad allows iPads enrolled in Intune to be shared among multiple employees or students.
   - It creates predefined user partitions on the device, ensuring separate storage for each user's apps, data, and preferences.
   - Federating your organization's Microsoft Entra instance with Apple Business or School Manager enables users to sign in using their Microsoft Entra credentials.
   - At first sign-in, a Managed Apple ID is created for the user, and they set up an alphanumeric passcode for their partition.

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Efficient Sharing**: Multiple users can utilize the same iPad, streamlining device usage.
   - **Data Separation**: User partitions keep apps and data separate, maintaining privacy.
   - **iCloud Backup**: Partitions can be backed up to iCloud, allowing seamless transitions across shared iPads.
   - **Managed Apple IDs**: Automatically created for users, simplifying sign-in.
   - **Supervised Mode**: Shared iPad requires supervision, enhancing control and security.

3. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Device Wipe**: If an enrollment profile with Shared iPad is sent to an unsupported device, a wipe is required.
   - **iOS/iPadOS Version Limitations**: Shared iPad isn't supported on iPhones or iPads running iOS/iPadOS versions earlier than 13.3.
   - **Conditional Access Limitations**: Some Conditional Access configurations are not supported with Shared iPad.

4. **Impact on End Users**:
   - **Positive**: Easier access, personalized experience, and efficient collaboration.
   - **Challenges**: Users need to remember their Managed Apple ID and passcode.
   - **Training**: Educating users on Shared iPad usage is essential.

5. **Difference from Shared Device Mode**:
   - **Shared Device Mode** (for iOS/iPadOS 13 and later):
     - Allows multiple users to sign in and out of apps using an Azure AD account.
     - Apps supporting Shared Device Mode provide global sign-in and sign-out functionality.
   - **Shared iPad**:
     - Creates separate user partitions.
     - Requires supervision and supports iCloud backup.
     - Federates with Microsoft Entra for sign-in.

In summary, Shared iPad in Intune facilitates efficient sharing, but it's essential to consider limitations and educate end users. Shared Device Mode, on the other hand, focuses on app sign-in and is distinct from Shared iPad.
