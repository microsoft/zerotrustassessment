# APNS Certificates
**Last Updated:** May 2025  
**Implementation Effort:** Low – The process involves a one-time setup and annual renewal, requiring targeted administrative actions without ongoing project work.  
**User Impact:** Low – End users are not directly involved; the certificate enables background device management functionality.

## Introduction

Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) certificates are a foundational requirement for managing macOS devices with Intune. Without a valid APNS certificate, Intune cannot communicate with Apple devices, making it impossible to enforce compliance policies, deploy configurations, or manage apps. This section helps macOS administrators ensure their APNS setup is secure, current, and aligned with Zero Trust principles.

This guidance applies to both new Intune environments and existing deployments that need to validate or renew their APNS configuration.

## Why This Matters

- **Enables device management**: APNS is required for Intune to push policies, apps, and commands to macOS devices.
- **Supports Zero Trust enforcement**: Without APNS, compliance and Conditional Access policies cannot be enforced.
- **Prevents management disruption**: An expired or misconfigured APNS certificate will break device communication.
- **Ensures continuity**: A valid APNS certificate is essential for ongoing policy evaluation and trust verification.

## Key Considerations

### What APNS Does

- Acts as a secure channel between Intune and Apple devices.
- Required for all MDM actions, including policy deployment, remote commands, and compliance checks.

### Certificate Requirements

- You must obtain an APNS certificate from Apple using a verified Apple ID.
- The certificate is valid for **one year** and must be renewed **before expiration** to avoid service disruption.
- The same Apple ID must be used for renewals to maintain continuity.

### Initial Setup

1. In the Intune admin center, navigate to:
   ```
   Devices > macOS > macOS enrollment > Apple MDM Push certificate
   ```
2. Download the CSR (certificate signing request) and upload it to the Apple Push Certificates Portal.
3. Download the signed certificate and upload it back into Intune.

### Renewal Process

- Set calendar reminders or use automation to track expiration dates.
- Renew the certificate using the **same Apple ID** used during initial setup.
- Validate that devices remain connected after renewal.

### Security Considerations

- Use a **dedicated Apple ID** for APNS management to avoid issues with personal or shared accounts.
- Store credentials securely and document the Apple ID used.
- Limit access to the Apple Push Certificates Portal to authorized personnel only.

### Monitoring and Alerts

- Intune provides alerts for upcoming APNS expiration.
- Use the **Intune admin center** or **Microsoft Graph API** to monitor certificate status and device connectivity.

## Zero Trust Considerations

- **Verify explicitly**: APNS enables real-time policy enforcement and device evaluation, which are critical for Zero Trust.
- **Assume breach**: A lapsed APNS certificate breaks the trust chain—devices can no longer be evaluated or remediated.
- **Continuous trust**: APNS ensures that compliance and Conditional Access policies are continuously applied and updated.

## Recommendations

- **Set up APNS early** in your Intune deployment to enable device management.
- **Use a dedicated Apple ID** and document it for continuity.
- **Renew the certificate annually** using the same Apple ID to avoid re-enrollment.
- **Monitor expiration dates proactively** and test device connectivity after renewal.
- **Restrict access** to the Apple Push Certificates Portal to reduce risk of accidental revocation or misconfiguration.
