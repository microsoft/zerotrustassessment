**Remote Help** in Intune is a cloud-based solution that allows IT support staff to remotely assist users with their devices. This feature enables secure, real-time connections between helpdesk personnel and end-users, facilitating troubleshooting and issue resolution. Remote Help uses strong authentication and security controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and assist with devices1.
