# MDM 01: Intune MDM for iOS and Android: Corporate-Owned vs BYOD Deployment Strategies

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
Customer IT teams must plan and execute enrollment strategies, configure policies, and support users across multiple device ownership models.

**User Impact:** Medium  
A subset of users—those using mobile devices for work—must follow enrollment steps and may experience changes in app behavior or access.

## Overview

Microsoft Intune supports two primary mobile device management (MDM) strategies for iOS and Android: **Corporate-Owned** and **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**. Each approach offers different levels of control, security, and user experience.

### Corporate-Owned Devices

These are fully managed by the organization. Intune offers several enrollment options:
- **Android**: Fully Managed, Dedicated, or Corporate-Owned Work Profile.
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Automated Device Enrollment via Apple Business Manager.

**Key Features:**
- Full control over device settings, apps, and security.
- Ideal for kiosk, frontline, or task-specific devices.
- Enables remote wipe, compliance enforcement, and app deployment.

**Risks if not deployed:** Without proper enrollment, corporate data may be exposed, and IT cannot enforce security baselines or compliance policies.

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)

These are personal devices voluntarily enrolled by users. Intune supports:
- **Mobile Application Management (MAM)** without device enrollment.
- **Work Profiles** (Android) or **User Enrollment** (iOS).

**Key Features:**
- Protects corporate data within apps (e.g., Outlook, Teams) without managing the entire device.
- Users retain control over personal data and apps.
- Less intrusive, better for user privacy.

**Risks if not deployed:** Sensitive data accessed on personal devices may be unprotected, increasing the risk of data leakage.

### Zero Trust Fit

This strategy aligns with the **"Use least privilege access"** principle. BYOD with MAM ensures only corporate data is managed, while corporate-owned devices enforce strict access controls and compliance.
