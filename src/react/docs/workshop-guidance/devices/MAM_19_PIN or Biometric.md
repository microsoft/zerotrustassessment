# PIN or Biometric

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
This is a straightforward configuration within Intune App Protection Policies and does not require device enrollment or infrastructure changes.

**User Impact:** Medium  
Users will need to authenticate using a PIN or biometric method (like Face ID or fingerprint) when accessing corporate apps, which may require communication and support for setup.

## Overview

Microsoft Intune App Protection Policies (APP) allow organizations to enforce access requirements such as PIN or biometric authentication (e.g., Face ID, fingerprint) before users can access corporate data within managed apps. These settings help ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information, even on personal or unmanaged devices. Admins can configure whether a PIN is required, whether biometric methods are allowed, and how frequently reauthentication is needed.

This feature supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Verify Explicitly"** by requiring strong user authentication based on identity and device context. Without this control, unauthorized users could potentially access corporate data if a device is lost, stolen, or shared.
