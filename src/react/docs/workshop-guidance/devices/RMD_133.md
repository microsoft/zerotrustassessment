### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: VPN profiles ensure that data transmitted between devices and the network is encrypted, protecting sensitive information.
2. **Centralized Management**: Intune allows you to manage and deploy VPN settings from a single console, simplifying administration.
3. **Consistency**: Ensures all devices have the same VPN settings, reducing configuration errors and ensuring compliance.
4. **User Convenience**: Users can connect to the VPN without manually configuring settings, improving their experience.

### Drawbacks
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Configuring VPN profiles, especially with advanced security settings, can be complex and time-consuming.
2. **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance is required to update VPN settings or troubleshoot connectivity issues.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Some older devices or specific network configurations might not fully support all VPN settings.

### Impact on End Users
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Users experience seamless and secure connectivity to the corporate network without manual configuration.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Properly configured VPN profiles reduce the risk of connectivity issues, minimizing downtime.
- **User Training**: Minimal training might be required to inform users about the new VPN setup.

### Tying to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every request. Deploying VPN profiles through Intune aligns with Zero Trust principles by:
- **Ensuring Secure Access**: VPN profiles enforce secure connections, ensuring only authorized devices can access the network.
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly updated VPN settings help maintain secure access, aligning with the continuous verification aspect of Zero Trust.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: By managing VPN settings centrally, you reduce the risk of misconfigurations that could be exploited.
