# 099: Kiosk Devices

## Overview

## Benefits

**Single-Purpose Use:** Kiosk devices are configured for specific tasks, such as digital signage, ticket printing, or inventory management. This ensures that the device is used only for its intended purpose.

**Enhanced Security:** By locking down the device to a single app or a limited set of apps, the risk of unauthorized access and misuse is significantly reduced.

**Simplified Management:** IT administrators can easily manage and update kiosk devices remotely, ensuring they are always up-to-date and compliant with organizational policies.

**Consistency:** Provides a consistent user experience across all kiosk devices, which is crucial for tasks that require uniformity.

## Drawbacks

**Limited Functionality:** Kiosk devices are restricted to specific apps and functions, which might not be suitable for all use cases.

**Initial Setup Complexity:** Setting up and configuring kiosk devices can be complex and time-consuming, requiring careful planning and execution.

**User Adaptation:** Users might need time to adapt to the restricted functionality, especially if they are used to more versatile devices.

## Impact on End Users

**Focused Use: Users will interact with devices that are tailored for specific tasks, which can improve efficiency and reduce distractions.

**Ease of Use:** The simplified interface can make it easier for users to perform their tasks without navigating through unnecessary apps or settings.

**Training:** Users may require training to understand how to use the kiosk devices effectively and to be aware of the limitations.

## Relation to Zero Trust

**Device Compliance:** Kiosk devices are configured to comply with strict security policies, ensuring they meet the Zero Trust principle of continuous compliance.

**Least Privilege:** By restricting devices to specific apps and functions, the principle of least privilege is enforced, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Continuous Monitoring:** Intune allows for continuous monitoring and management of kiosk devices, ensuring they remain secure and compliant with organizational policies.
