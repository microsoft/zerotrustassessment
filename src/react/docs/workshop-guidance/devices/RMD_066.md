4. Click **Select** to display the **Add app** steps.
5. Select **Search the App Store**.
6. In the **Search the App Store** pane, pick the **App Store country/region locale**.
7. Type the name (or part of the name) of the app in the search box.
8. Intune will search the store and return a list of relevant results.
9. Choose the app you want from the results, and then select **Select**.
10. On the **App information** page, add details like the app name, description, publisher, App Store URL, minimum operating system version, applicable device type, category, and more.
