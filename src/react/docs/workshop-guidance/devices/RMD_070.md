# 070: User enrollment

## Overview

1. **Overview**:
   - **Apple User Enrollment** is designed for securely using personally owned devices (BYOD) for work apps without giving up management of the entire device to organizations.
   - It sets up the personal device so that work data is stored separately from personal data and apps.
   - **Supervised mode** isn't available with this enrollment type.
   - **Supported methods**:
     - **Account-driven user enrollment**: The device user initiates enrollment by adding their work or school account in the Settings app. Intune policies are applied silently.
     - **User enrollment with Company Portal**: The user signs into the Intune Company Portal app, downloads a preconfigured enrollment profile, and installs it via the Settings app.
   - **Privacy**: Organizations can apply necessary configurations and policies (e.g., passcode requirements, mandatory apps) without controlling the camera or accessing personal informationÂ².

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Privacy**: Separates work data from personal data, respecting user privacy.
   - **User-friendly**: Simple enrollment process for users.
   - **Limited management**: Admins have a restricted set of policies and configurations.
   - **BYOD support**: Ideal for personal devices.

3. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Limited control**: Admins cannot fully manage the entire device.
   - **No supervision**: No supervised mode for additional control.
   - **Restricted settings**: Only settings supported by Apple User Enrollment take effect.

4. **Impact**:
   - **Positive**: Easy enrollment, privacy protection.
   - **Negative**: Limited device management.

5. **Comparison to ABM Enrollment**:
   - **Apple Business Manager (ABM)**: For corporate-owned devices.
     - **Supervised mode**: Provides more control.
     - **Full management**: Admins can manage the entire device.
     - **Ideal for corporate devices**.

In summary, Apple User Enrollment balances privacy and management, making it suitable for BYOD scenarios, while ABM offers more control for corporate devices.
