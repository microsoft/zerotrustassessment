# 080: Remote Help

## Overview

1. **Overview**:
   - **Remote Help** is a cloud-based solution that enables secure help desk connections with role-based access controls.
   - Support staff can remotely connect to users' devices to troubleshoot issues.

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Efficient Support**: Technicians can assist users without being physically present, improving response time.
   - **Secure Connection**: Remote Help ensures encrypted connections for data privacy.
   - **Role-Based Access**: Admins can control the level of access helpers have, enhancing security.
   - **Compliance Warnings**: Helpers receive non-compliance warnings if a device violates policies.

3. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Network Dependency**: Requires an internet connection for remote assistance.
   - **Device Enrollment**: Devices must be enrolled in Intune and Entra registered.
   - **Organization Login**: Both helper and sharer need Microsoft Entra accounts from your organization.
   - **Platform Limitations**: Specific capabilities vary by platform (Windows, Android, macOS).

4. **Impact on End Users**:
   - **Positive**: Faster issue resolution, reduced downtime.
   - **Negative**: Users may feel uncomfortable with remote access to their devices.

5. **Licensing Requirements**:
   - **Intune Suite Add-On**: Remote Help is available as an Intune add-on.
   - **TeamViewer Solution**: Intune also offers a third-party integrated solution (TeamViewer) for remote assistance, but it comes with additional license charges.

Remember, always consider your organization's specific needs and policies when implementing Remote Help!
