# 125: WSUS to Autopatch

## Overview

You can accelerate and simplify the processes around updating Windows by moving the Windows Updates workload to Intune. This also enables you to schedule and deploy updates (including the Windows 11 upgrade) with [Windows Autopatch](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/overview/windows-autopatch-overview) and ultimately choose the level of control that’s best for your organization. This allows you to immediately take advantage of:

* Cloud-delivered driver and firmware updates
* Simplified configuration with automatic gradual rollouts
* Safeguard holds to help protect against known compatibility issues
* Using Windows Update for Business reports for Windows Updates in Microsoft Intune
