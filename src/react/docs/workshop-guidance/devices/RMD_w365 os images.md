**Windows 365 Operating System Images**

**Implementation Effort:** Medium -- Admins must choose between default
gallery images or create, validate, and upload custom images that meet
strict technical requirements.

**User Impact:** Low -- Users receive Cloud PCs with preconfigured OS
images; no action or awareness is required from them.

**Overview**

Windows 365 uses operating system images to provision Cloud PCs. Admins
can select from Microsoft-provided **gallery images** or upload **custom
images** stored in Azure. Gallery images are preconfigured with Windows
10/11 Enterprise, Microsoft 365 Apps, and Teams optimizations, and are
updated monthly with security patches and performance improvements.
Custom images allow organizations to tailor the OS environment but must
meet specific requirements, such as being generalized, Gen2, and not
previously enrolled in Intune or Active Directory.

Using outdated or misconfigured images can lead to provisioning
failures, degraded performance, or security vulnerabilities. This
capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **Verify explicitly**,
as image integrity and configuration directly affect the security
posture of the Cloud PC environment.
