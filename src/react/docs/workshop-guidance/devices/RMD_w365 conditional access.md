**Windows 365 Conditional Access**

**Implementation Effort:** Medium\
Setting up Conditional Access requires IT and security teams to define,
test, and deploy policies using Microsoft Entra and Intune, but does not
require ongoing user training or infrastructure changes.

**User Impact:** Medium\
Users may be prompted for multifactor authentication or blocked from
accessing Cloud PCs based on risk signals, device compliance, or
location, which may require communication and support.

**Overview**

Conditional Access for Windows 365 allows organizations to enforce
access controls based on user identity, device compliance, location, and
risk signals. These policies act as \"if-then\" rules---for example, if
a user accesses a Cloud PC from an unmanaged device, then they must
complete multifactor authentication (MFA). Admins can target policies to
the following Microsoft Entra apps:

- Windows 365

- Azure Virtual Desktop

- Microsoft Remote Desktop

- Windows Cloud Login

Conditional Access policies are configured using Microsoft Entra ID
(formerly Azure AD) and can be managed through Microsoft Intune. These
policies help ensure that only trusted users and devices can access
Cloud PCs, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. If not implemented,
organizations risk exposing sensitive resources to compromised accounts
or unmanaged devices.

This feature supports the Zero Trust principle of **\"Verify
explicitly\"** by requiring authentication and authorization based on
real-time signals such as user risk, device health, and location.
