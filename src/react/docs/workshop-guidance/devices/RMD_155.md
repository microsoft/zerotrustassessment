# 155: Review logs using Azure Monitor in Microsoft Intune

**Implementation Effort:**  
**Medium** – IT and Security Operations teams need to configure diagnostic settings, choose appropriate destinations (Log Analytics, Azure Storage, Event Hubs), and manage retention and access policies.

**User Impact:**  
**Low** – This feature operates entirely in the background. It affects only administrators and security teams; end users are not notified and do not need to take any action.

## Overview

This feature allows organizations to export Intune logs and diagnostic data to **Azure Monitor**, **Log Analytics**, **Azure Storage**, or **Event Hubs**. It supports centralized monitoring, long-term storage, and integration with SIEM tools for advanced analysis. Admins can track device compliance, configuration profiles, app deployments, and more.

If not implemented, organizations may lack visibility into device and policy health, miss early indicators of misconfigurations or threats, and be unable to meet compliance or audit requirements.

This supports the **Zero Trust principle of “Assume Breach”** by enabling continuous monitoring and threat detection through centralized log analysis.
