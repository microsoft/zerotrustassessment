# Passwordless and Windows Hello for Business (WHfB)

**Implementation Effort:** Medium — Requires IT to configure policies via Intune or Group Policy and coordinate across identity, device, and security teams.  
**User Impact:** Medium — A subset of users must enroll biometrics or PINs and may need guidance during provisioning.

## Overview

**Windows Hello for Business (WHfB)** is a passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with two-factor authentication using biometrics or PINs and device-bound cryptographic keys. It enhances security by eliminating passwords, which are often the weakest link in identity protection, and ensures that only trusted users on compliant, registered devices can access corporate resources.

WHfB supports multiple trust models—**cloud trust**, **key trust**, and **certificate trust**—to align with different identity architectures. It integrates with **Microsoft Intune** and **Conditional Access** to enforce policies at scale across hybrid and cloud environments.

By adopting WHfB, organizations reduce the risk of credential theft and phishing attacks, improve user experience, and align with the **Zero Trust principle of verifying explicitly**—authenticating based on user identity, device health, and compliance status.

**Risks if not deployed:** Continued reliance on passwords increases exposure to phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks, weakening the organization's security posture.
