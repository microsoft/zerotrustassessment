# Intune Advanced Analytics

**Implementation Effort:** **Medium**  
This feature requires IT teams to onboard devices into Endpoint Analytics, assign appropriate licenses (via Intune Suite or add-on), configure role-based access, and potentially train staff on using  tools like anomaly detection and KQL for device queries.

**User Impact:** **Low**  
The feature operates in the background and is used by IT admins; end users are not required to take action or be notified.

### **Overview**

**Microsoft Intune Advanced Analytics** is an add-on to Endpoint Analytics that provides deeper insights into device performance, user experience, and operational health. It includes capabilities like:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies regressions in user experience after configuration changes.
- **Enhanced Device Timeline**: Offers more granular event data for troubleshooting.
- **Device Query**: Enables near real-time querying of device state using KQL.
- **Battery Health & Resource Performance Reports**: Helps identify hardware issues affecting productivity.

These tools help IT proactively detect and resolve issues, reducing support costs and improving user satisfaction. It aligns with the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enabling continuous monitoring and rapid response to anomalies.

If not implemented, organizations risk delayed detection of performance issues, higher support costs, and reduced end-user productivity due to unresolved device problems.
