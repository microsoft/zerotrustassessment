# 088: Conditional access policy

## Overview

1. **What is Device-Based Conditional Access?**
   - Device-based Conditional Access combines **Intune device compliance policies** with **Conditional Access policies** to enforce security and compliance standards.
   - It ensures that only compliant devices can access your organization's apps and services.

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Granular Control**: You can specify which apps or services to protect, conditions for access, and the targeted users.
   - **Enhanced Security**: By requiring devices to be marked as compliant, you strengthen security posture.
   - **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Azure AD Conditional Access.
   - **App-Based Conditional Access**: You can also use app-based policies alongside device-based ones.

3. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Complexity**: Setting up and managing policies can be intricate.
   - **User Experience**: Non-compliant devices may face restrictions, impacting user access.
   - **Configuration Challenges**: Proper setup requires configuring both Intune compliance policies and Conditional Access policies.

4. **Impact on End Users**:
   - **Positive**: Improved security, seamless access for compliant devices.
   - **Negative**: Non-compliant devices may experience restricted access or additional authentication steps.

Remember to configure **Intune device compliance policies** before setting up Conditional Access.
