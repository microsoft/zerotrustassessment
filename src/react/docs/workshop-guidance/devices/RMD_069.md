# 069: Webapp Deployment

## Overview
To add a web app to Microsoft Intune as a shortcut on iOS/iPadOS devices, follow these steps:


**Benefits of Web App Deployment in Microsoft Intune:**
1. **Simplified Management**: Intune allows you to add web apps as shortcuts on users' devices. This streamlines management and ensures consistent access across platforms.
2. **End-User Convenience**: For iOS/iPadOS devices, a shortcut to the web app is added to the home screen.
3. **Separate Maintenance**: Web apps are maintained independently on the web, reducing the burden on IT teams.
4. **Automatic Updates**: Most webapps deployed via Intune receive automatic updates, including bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements.
5. **Contextual Policies**: Policies only apply in a work context, protecting company data without affecting personal data.

**Drawbacks and Considerations:**
1. **Browser Dependency**: Users must have a compatible browser installed to launch web apps.
2. **Limited Customization**: Once deployed, the app URL cannot be modified in Intune.

**Impact on End Users:**
- End users benefit from streamlined access to web apps, but they need to be aware of any browser requirements and limitations.
