# 182: FileVault encryption

## Overview

Managing macOS devices remotely using Microsoft Intune involves several steps and offers various benefits and drawbacks. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy Remote Actions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary licenses for Microsoft Intune.
   - Verify that macOS devices are enrolled in Intune and connected to the internet.

2. **Access the Intune Admin Center**:
   - Sign in to the Intune admin center.
   - Navigate to **Devices > All devices** and select the macOS device you want to manage.

3. **Available Remote Actions**:
   - **Restart**: Remotely restart the device.
   - **Wipe**: Erase all data on the device and reset it to factory settings.
   - **Lock**: Lock the device to prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Reset Password**: Reset the user's password.
   - **Sync**: Force the device to check in with Intune to receive the latest policies and configurations.
   - **Collect Diagnostics**: Gather diagnostic logs for troubleshooting.
   - **Remote Help**: Start a remote assistance session to help users with issues.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Control**: Provides IT administrators with the ability to manage and troubleshoot devices remotely, reducing downtime.
- **Improved Security**: Allows for quick responses to security incidents, such as wiping a lost or stolen device.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines device management processes, saving time and resources.

### Drawbacks

- **Complex Setup**: Initial configuration and setup can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Dependency on Internet**: Remote actions require the device to be connected to the internet.
- **User Disruption**: Some actions, like restarting or wiping a device, can disrupt the user's work.

### Impact on End Users

- **Performance**: Users might notice a slight decrease in performance during remote actions.
- **Notifications**: Users will receive notifications related to remote actions, such as password resets or device locks.
- **Assistance**: Remote help sessions can provide timely support, improving user satisfaction.

### Tying to Zero Trust

Deploying remote actions for macOS devices aligns with the Zero Trust security model by ensuring that:

- **Continuous Verification**: Every access request and action is continuously verified, regardless of where the request originates.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Assume Breach**: The system is designed with the assumption that a breach has already occurred, ensuring robust detection and response mechanisms.
