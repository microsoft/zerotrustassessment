# 085: Offboarding Devices

## Overview

**Benefits:**
1. **Security and Compliance:** By offboarding devices, you ensure that only authorized and actively managed devices have access to company resources. This helps maintain security and compliance.
2. **Resource Optimization:** Removing inactive or outdated devices frees up licenses and reduces administrative overhead.
3. **Improved Performance:** Streamlining the device pool can enhance Intune's performance and responsiveness.

**Drawbacks:**
1. **User Disruption:** Offboarding may impact end users who lose access to company data or apps if their devices are removed.
2. **Administrative Effort:** Managing offboarding processes requires administrative effort, especially for large organizations.
3. **Potential Errors:** Mistakenly offboarding active devices can cause disruptions and user frustration.

**Impact to End Users:**
- For user-based management methods (such as Android Enterprise personally owned with a work profile, corporate-owned work profile, fully managed, and AOSP user-based), Android devices running Android 9 or earlier will no longer be supported.
- Users won't be able to enroll devices with Android device administrator (January 2025), and Intune won't provide updates or support for these devices.
- In some cases, users may experience issues like missing approved Managed Home Screen apps.

To prepare, use Intune reporting to identify affected devices or users. Check the OS version and consider migrating to supported Android versions.
