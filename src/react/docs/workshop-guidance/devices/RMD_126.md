# 126: Compliance Policies

## Overview
### Windows Compliance Policies in Microsoft Intune

**Windows Compliance Policies** in Microsoft Intune are sets of rules and conditions used to evaluate the configuration of managed devices. These policies help ensure that devices meet specific security and compliance requirements before accessing organizational resources.

#### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Compliance policies help protect organizational data by ensuring that only devices meeting security standards can access resources.
2. **Conditional Access Integration**: When combined with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, compliance policies provide an extra layer of security by enforcing access controls based on device compliance status.
3. **Customizable Policies**: Administrators can create platform-specific rules tailored to their organization's needs.
4. **Automated Compliance Checks**: Devices are automatically evaluated against compliance policies, reducing the need for manual checks.

#### Drawbacks
1. **Complexity**: Setting up and managing compliance policies can be complex, especially for organizations with diverse device environments.
2. **User Disruption**: Non-compliant devices may be restricted from accessing resources, which can disrupt users' work if they are unaware of the compliance requirements.

#### Impact on End Users
- **Access Restrictions**: Users with non-compliant devices may experience restricted access to corporate resources, which can impact productivity.
- **Increased Security Awareness**: Users may become more aware of security practices and the importance of maintaining compliant devices.
- **Potential Frustration**: If compliance policies are not well-communicated, users may feel frustrated by sudden access restrictions.

#### Relation to Zero Trust
Windows Compliance Policies in Intune align with the **Zero Trust** security model, which assumes that all devices, users, and applications are untrustworthy until verified. Key aspects include:
- **Verification**: Compliance policies ensure that devices are verified and meet security standards before accessing resources.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Devices are continuously monitored for compliance, aligning with Zero Trust principles of ongoing verification.
- **Conditional Access**: Integration with Conditional Access policies enforces Zero Trust by allowing only compliant devices to access sensitive data.
