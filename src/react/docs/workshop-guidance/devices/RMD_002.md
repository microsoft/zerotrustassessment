# 002: Device groups

**Implementation Effort:** Low – IT and Security Operations teams need to create new devices groups.

**User Impact:** Low - The end users will not experience any new prompt or changes on their devices.

## Overview
1. **Overview of Intune Grouping and Targeting Concepts**:
   - **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Groups**: Intune primarily uses Azure AD groups for grouping and targeting. These groups allow you to assign apps, policies, and other workloads to users and devices. They're also used for role-based administration (RBAC) as scope groups.
   - **Virtual Groups**: The "All users" and "All devices" assignments are Intune's virtual groups. They exist by default in all Intune tenants and don't require manual management. They're highly scalable and optimized.
   - **Filters**: Filters allow you to narrow the assignment scope of apps and policies. You can target user or device groups and filter devices based on specific properties. Filtering is high-performance and evaluated during device check-in without pre-computation¹.

2. **Benefits of Device Groups**:
   - **Granularity**: Device groups allow precise targeting. You can create groups based on device properties (e.g., OS version, compliance status).
   - **Efficiency**: Assigning policies to smaller device groups reduces synchronization overhead and speeds up deployments.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Device groups help isolate issues by narrowing down the affected devices.

3. **Drawbacks and Considerations**:
   - **Synchronization Backlogs**: Large Azure AD groups with many users or devices can cause synchronization delays. Policy and app deployments take longer to reach managed devices¹.
   - **Tattooed Settings**: If settings or apps are applied before device filters are evaluated, troubleshooting unexpected configurations becomes challenging².

4. **Device Groups vs. User Groups**:
   - **Device Groups**: Ideal for device-specific policies (e.g., security settings, app installations).
   - **User Groups**: Useful for user-centric policies (e.g., user-targeted apps, conditional access).
