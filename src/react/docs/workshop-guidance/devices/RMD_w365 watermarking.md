**Windows 365 Watermarking**

**Implementation Effort:** Medium\
Enabling watermarking requires configuring policies via Intune or Group
Policy and ensuring client compatibility, which involves coordination
between IT and security teams.

**User Impact:** Medium\
Users may notice visible QR code overlays during Cloud PC sessions, and
unsupported clients will be blocked from connecting, which may require
user communication and support.

**Overview**

Windows 365 watermarking is a security feature that overlays QR code
watermarks on Cloud PC remote desktop sessions to discourage
unauthorized screen captures and data leakage. Each watermark includes
session-specific metadata such as the connection ID, device ID, and
timestamp, allowing administrators to trace activity if sensitive data
is exposed.

This feature cannot prevent physical photography of the screen. However,
it supports the Zero Trust principle of **\"Assume breach\"** by helping
trace and deter data exfiltration attempts.

If watermarking is not deployed, organizations risk untraceable data
leaks from screen captures, especially in high-sensitivity environments.
