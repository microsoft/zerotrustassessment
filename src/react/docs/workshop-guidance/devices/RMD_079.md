# 079: Mobile Threat Defense

## Overview
Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) integration with Microsoft Intune allows you to enhance security for mobile devices. Here's how it works:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Intune integrates data from third-party MTD vendors as an information source for device compliance policies and Conditional Access rules.
   - This integration helps protect corporate resources (such as Exchange and SharePoint) by blocking access from compromised mobile devices.

2. **How It Works**:
   - Intune uses a Mobile Threat Defense connector to communicate with your chosen MTD vendor.
   - MTD partners offer easy-to-deploy applications for mobile devices that actively scan and analyze threat information.
   - The MTD app reports threat data to the vendor, which categorizes it as low, medium, or high risk.
   - Intune compares this risk level with your configured allowances.
   - Based on the comparison, access to specific resources can be revoked if the device is compromised.

3. **Setting It Up**:
   - Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center.
   - Go to Tenant administration > Connectors and tokens > Mobile Threat Defense.
   - To set up integration with an MTD vendor, you need to be a Microsoft Enterprise Global administrator or have the Endpoint Security Manager built-in admin role for Intune.
