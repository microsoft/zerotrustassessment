# 150: Endpoint Analytics

## Overview

**Endpoint Analytics** in Intune provides insights into the performance and health of your devices. It helps identify issues that might be affecting user productivity, such as long boot times or software configurations that aren't optimized. By collecting and analyzing data from your devices, Endpoint Analytics enables IT to proactively address these issues before they impact users.

To use Endpoint Analytics, you need to enable data collection on your devices. This involves creating a policy in Intune that targets the devices you want to monitor. The data collected includes information about boot times, application performance, and other metrics that can help you understand and improve the user experience.

Endpoint Analytics supports the Zero Trust security model by providing visibility into device health and performance. Zero Trust assumes that breaches can occur at any time, so continuous monitoring and assessment are crucial
