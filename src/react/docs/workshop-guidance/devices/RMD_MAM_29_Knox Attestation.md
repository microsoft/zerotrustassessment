# Knox Attestation

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Knox Attestation is a built-in option for supported Samsung devices and can be enabled through a simple policy configuration in Intune.

**User Impact:** Low  
Users are not affected unless their device fails the attestation check, in which case access to corporate data is silently blocked or wiped.

## Overview

**Knox Attestation** is a hardware-backed integrity check available on Samsung devices that verifies whether the device has been tampered with or rooted. In Microsoft Intune, administrators can configure App Protection Policies (APP) to require Knox Attestation as a condition for accessing corporate data. If the device fails the attestation check, Intune can automatically wipe organizational data from the app.

This setting is particularly useful in high-security environments where device integrity is critical. It ensures that only healthy, unmodified Samsung devices can access sensitive data, even in BYOD scenarios. Microsoft recommends setting the Knox Attestation policy action to **"Wipe data"** to ensure corporate data is removed if the device fails the check.

This feature supports the **Zero Trust principle of "Assume Breach"** by enforcing hardware-level verification of device health before granting access to corporate resources.
