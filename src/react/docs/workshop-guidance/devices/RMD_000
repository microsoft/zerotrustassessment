# Overview Devices Pillar

**Implementation Effort:** High

**User Impact:** High

## Overview
Once an identity has been granted access to a resource, data can flow to a variety of different endpoints (devices), from IoT devices to smartphones, BYOD to partner-managed devices, and on-premises workloads to cloud-hosted servers. 
This diversity creates a massive attack surface area. Monitor and enforce device health and compliance for secure access.
In a Zero Trust approach, the same security policies are applied regardless of whether the device is corporate-owned or personally owned through bring your own device (BYOD); whether the device is fully managed by IT, or only the apps and data are secured. 
The policies apply to all endpoints, whether PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet, wearable, or IoT device wherever they are connected, be it the secure corporate network, home broadband, or public internet. Most importantly, the health and trustworthiness of apps that run on those endpoints impacts your security posture.
You need to prevent corporate data from leaking to untrusted or unknown apps or services, either accidentally or through malicious intent.

### Key Principles of the Zero Trust Network Model
Instead of assuming that everything behind the corporate firewall is secure, an end-to-end Zero Trust strategy acknowledges that breaches are inevitable. 
This approach requires verifying each request as if it originates from an uncontrolled network, with identity management playing a crucial role. 
When organizations incorporate the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Zero Trust models and patterns, they enhance their security posture and better protect their networks.

To make this happen, follow three Zero Trust principles:

- Verify explicitly. Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. Include user identity, location, device health, service or workload, user and device risk, data classification, and anomalies.
- Use least-privileged access. Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
- Assume breach. Minimize influence radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and application awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end to end. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

Zero Trust (ZT) is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request. The Devices Pillar in Zero Trust focuses on securing the devices our users use to connect to your services and operate on your data.
