# 188: Driver Updates

## Overview

Drivers Update policies in Intune allow you to manage and deploy driver and firmware updates for Windows devices. These policies help ensure that devices have the latest drivers and firmware, which are essential for optimal performance and security. You can configure these policies to automatically approve recommended updates or require manual approval before deployment.

To manage these updates, Intune leverages the Windows Update for Business deployment service. This service identifies applicable updates for your devices and provides detailed reporting on update status, alerts, and recommendations for remediation. This helps you monitor the health and performance of your devices and ensures that updates are applied consistently across your organization.

Managing drivers and firmware updates is crucial. Zero Trust assumes that breaches can occur at any time, so maintaining up-to-date drivers and firmware is essential to minimize vulnerabilities.
