**Windows 365 Network Options**

**Implementation Effort:** Medium -- IT admins must choose between
Microsoft-hosted or customer-managed networking, with setup and policy
configuration required for either option.

**User Impact:** Low -- Network configuration is transparent to end
users; no user action or communication is required.

**Overview**

Windows 365 offers two main network deployment options:
**Microsoft-hosted network** and **Azure Network Connection (ANC)**. The
Microsoft-hosted option is a fully managed SaaS model where Microsoft
handles all networking infrastructure, ideal for organizations seeking
simplicity and rapid deployment. It supports Microsoft Entra join and
requires no Azure subscription or networking expertise. The ANC option
allows organizations to use their own Azure virtual networks, offering
more control and integration with on-premises infrastructure, and
supports both Microsoft Entra join and hybrid join.

Choosing the right network model is critical for performance, security,
and compliance. Misconfiguration or improper planning---especially with
ANC---can lead to connectivity issues, policy misalignment, or exposure
to threats. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of
**Assume breach**, as Microsoft-hosted networks are built with
end-to-end security controls, and ANC allows for granular policy
enforcement and segmentation.
