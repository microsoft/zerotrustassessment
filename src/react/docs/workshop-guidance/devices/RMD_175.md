# 175: Deploy macOS SSO extension

## Overview
Deploying the macOS Single Sign-On (SSO) extension using Microsoft Intune can streamline authentication processes for users and enhance security. Here's a detailed overview:

### Steps to Deploy macOS SSO Extension

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure devices are running macOS 13.0 or newer.
   - Install the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app version 5.2404.0 or newer.

2. **Decide Authentication Method**:
   - Choose between passwordless authentication, Microsoft Entra ID user accounts, or smart cards.

3. **Create Platform SSO Policy in Intune**:
   - Navigate to the Intune admin center.
   - Go to **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
   - Select **macOS** for the platform and **Device features** for the profile type.
   - Configure the SSO app extension settings¹.

4. **Deploy the Company Portal App**:
   - Ensure the Company Portal app is deployed to all macOS devices.

5. **Enroll Devices and Apply Policies**:
   - Enroll the macOS devices in Intune.
   - Assign the SSO policy to the relevant user groups.

6. **Confirm Settings on Devices**:
   - Verify that the SSO settings are correctly applied on the devices.

### Benefits

- **Reduced Authentication Prompts**: Users experience fewer sign-in prompts, enhancing productivity.
- **Enhanced Security**: Supports passwordless authentication and integrates with Microsoft Entra ID for secure access.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Users can sign in using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials and Touch ID.
- **Conditional Access**: Ensures that only compliant devices can access corporate resources.

### Drawbacks

- **Compatibility Issues**: Some older macOS versions may not support the latest SSO features.
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires careful configuration and testing to ensure seamless deployment.
- **Dependency on Microsoft Entra ID**: Organizations must be using Microsoft Entra ID for full functionality.

### Possible Impact on End Users

- **Improved User Experience**: Fewer sign-in prompts and easier access to resources.
- **Learning Curve**: Users may need initial guidance on using new authentication methods like Touch ID.
- **Increased Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security measures, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Tying to Zero Trust

The deployment of the macOS SSO extension aligns with Zero Trust principles by:

- **Verifying Identity**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access resources.
- **Conditional Access**: Enforces policies that require devices to meet security standards before granting access.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Limits access to resources based on user roles and compliance status.
