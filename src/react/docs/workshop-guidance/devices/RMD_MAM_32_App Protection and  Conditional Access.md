# App Protection and Conditional Access

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
Once foundational policies are in place, enabling app protection with Conditional Access is a straightforward configuration within Intune and Entra ID.

**User Impact:** Medium  
Users may be required to switch to approved apps (e.g., Outlook instead of native mail apps) and complete additional authentication steps, which may require communication and support.

## Overview

**App Protection and Conditional Access** work together in Microsoft Intune to ensure that only trusted apps and users can access corporate data. App Protection Policies (APP) define how data is protected within apps, while Conditional Access policies control who can access what, under which conditions. When combined, this is known as **App-based Conditional Access**.

For example, an organization can enforce that only apps with Intune APP applied—like Microsoft Outlook—can access Exchange Online, while blocking native mail apps. Conditional Access policies can also require device compliance, multi-factor authentication, or app-based restrictions before granting access to Microsoft 365 services.

This integration supports both managed and unmanaged (BYOD) devices, providing flexibility while maintaining security. It ensures that only apps that support modern authentication and are protected by Intune policies can access sensitive data.

This setup supports the **Zero Trust principles of "Verify Explicitly"** and **"Use Least Privilege Access"** by enforcing identity, device, and app conditions before granting access to corporate resources.
