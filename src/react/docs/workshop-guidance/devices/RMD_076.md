# 076: App config settings

## Overview

1. **What are App Configuration Policies?**
   - App configuration policies allow you to assign configuration settings to an app before end-users run it.
   - These settings are automatically applied when the app is configured on the end-user's device, eliminating setup issues.
   - You can customize each app with unique settings, such as custom port numbers, language preferences, security settings, and branding elements (like company logos).
   - By using app configuration policies, you ensure consistency across your organization and reduce helpdesk calls related to manual configuration.

2. **Benefits of App Configuration Policies:**
   - **Efficiency**: Simplify app setup for end-users by pre-configuring settings.
   - **Consistency**: Ensure uniform settings across devices and users.
   - **Faster Adoption**: New apps can be deployed more easily and quickly.
   - **Reduced Errors**: End-users won't need to manually enter settings, minimizing mistakes.

3. **Drawbacks and Considerations:**
   - **Developer Support**: Configuration parameters depend on app developers; check app documentation for available settings.
   - **Limited Scope**: App configuration policies apply only to work context, not personal use.
   - **Platform-Specific**: Available for both iOS/iPadOS and Android apps.

4. **Impact on End Users:**
   - **Positive**: Streamlined app setup, consistent experience.
   - **Negative**: None, as policies don't affect personal app usage.

5. **Difference from App Protection Policies:**
   - **App Protection Policies**: Focus on data protection (e.g., encryption, PIN requirements) without affecting app functionality in personal context.
   - **App Configuration Policies**: Customize app settings for better user experience and consistency.

Remember, always review app documentation to understand available configurations and their impact on app behavior.
