# Enrollment Notifications

**Last Updated:** May 2025  
**Implementation Effort:** Low – Admins only need to configure notification templates and assign them to enrollment profiles.  
**User Impact:** Medium – Notifications are sent to users during enrollment, which may prompt questions or support requests.

## Introduction

Enrollment notifications in Intune allow organizations to send automated messages to users when their macOS device is successfully enrolled. These notifications help reinforce trust, improve transparency, and provide users with next steps or support information. From a Zero Trust perspective, they also serve as a checkpoint to confirm that enrollment occurred as expected and that the device is now subject to compliance and access policies.

This section helps administrators evaluate whether and how they are using enrollment notifications to support secure onboarding and user awareness.

## Why This Matters

- **Improves user transparency** by confirming successful enrollment.  
- **Supports Zero Trust** by reinforcing that device trust is established only after enrollment.  
- **Reduces help desk tickets** by proactively providing guidance or support links.  
- **Confirms device ownership and intent**, especially in BYOD scenarios.  
- **Establishes a communication baseline** for future device lifecycle events.

## Key Considerations

### Notification Triggers

- Enrollment notifications are triggered when a device is successfully enrolled into Intune.  
- Applies to both **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)** and **user-initiated enrollment**.  

### Supported Channels

- Notifications are sent via **email** to the user associated with the enrolled device.  
- The email address must be available in Azure AD and associated with the user’s Intune enrollment.  

### Customizing the Message

You can customize:

- Subject line and message body  
- Branding (organization name, logo)  
- Support contact information or links to onboarding resources  

Use this opportunity to reinforce security expectations and next steps (e.g., “Your device is now managed and must remain compliant to access corporate resources”).

### Use Cases for macOS

- Confirm successful enrollment for BYOD users to reduce confusion.  
- Provide links to self-service portals, VPN setup guides, or compliance FAQs.  
- Reinforce that the device is now subject to Conditional Access policies.  

### Monitoring and Testing

- Test notification delivery across different enrollment scenarios (corporate vs. BYOD).  
- Monitor user feedback and adjust messaging to improve clarity and usefulness.

## Zero Trust Considerations

- **Verify explicitly**: Notifications confirm that enrollment has occurred and that the device is now subject to policy evaluation.  
- **Assume breach**: Clear communication helps users understand that access is conditional and monitored.  
- **Least privilege**: Reinforcing compliance expectations helps ensure users understand that access is earned, not assumed.  
- **Continuous trust**: Notifications can serve as the first step in a broader communication strategy around device compliance and lifecycle.

## Recommendations

- **Enable enrollment notifications** for all macOS enrollment paths (ADE and user-initiated).  
- **Customize the message** to include support links, compliance expectations, and next steps.  
- **Use consistent branding** to build user trust and reduce phishing risk.  
- **Test across scenarios** to ensure delivery and clarity.  
- **Review and update messaging** periodically to reflect current policies and Zero Trust posture.  
- **Use notifications as a trust checkpoint**, especially in BYOD environments where user awareness is critical.
