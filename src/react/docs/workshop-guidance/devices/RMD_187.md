# 187: Enterprise App Management

**Implementation Effort:** Low  
IT admins need to configure and manage app deployments using the Enterprise App Catalog, but the process is streamlined with pre-filled install commands, detection rules, and update settings provided by Microsoft.

**User Impact:** Low  
Most changes are transparent to users unless specific app interactions or updates require user awareness.

## Overview

Intune’s Enterprise App Management (EAM) streamlines the discovery, deployment, and updating of Win32 applications from a curated enterprise app catalog with a collection of Microsoft and third-party apps. 

Aligned with Zero Trust’s pillars of *explicit verification*, *least privilege*, and *assume breach*, EAM allows IT administrators to:

- **Discover and deploy apps** directly from the Intune console, reducing risk and manual overhead.
- **Keep apps updated**, ensuring endpoints remain secure and compliant.
- **Integrate with Windows Autopilot**, allowing apps to be installed during device provisioning

As part of the **Intune Suite add-on**, EAM enhances endpoint security posture, simplifies lifecycle management, and ensures policy-compliant access to corporate resources.
