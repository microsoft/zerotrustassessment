**Windows 365 Regions**

**Implementation Effort:** Low\
Selecting a region is typically a one-time configuration during
provisioning and does not require ongoing administrative effort.

**User Impact:** Low\
Users are not directly affected by region selection unless performance
or compliance issues arise, so no user action or notification is needed.

**Overview**

Windows 365 uses Azure regions to host Cloud PCs, and the region is
determined by the virtual network selected during provisioning. For
Microsoft-hosted networks, region selection is automatic, but for
customer-managed networks, admins must choose an Azure region that
aligns with their network and compliance needs. Microsoft recommends
using the **Automatic** option to ensure optimal availability and
capacity. Region selection affects latency, data residency, and
regulatory compliance. If the wrong region is selected, users may
experience degraded performance or the organization may face compliance
risks.

This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **\"Assume
breach\"** by enabling geographic segmentation and data residency
controls, which help reduce the blast radius in case of a security
incident.
