# 068: VPP app deployment

## Overview
To manage iOS apps purchased through the Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) using Microsoft Intune, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to Intune**: Log in to the Intune for Education portal or the Microsoft Intune admin center.
2. **Navigate to Apps**: Click on "Apps" and select "iOS Apps" or "macOS."
3. **Choose Your Country/Region**: Specify the country/region from where you're purchasing the app.
4. **Search for the App**: Type in the app's full or partial name. Intune will return relevant results from the App Store.
5. **Select the App**: Choose the app you want to manage.
6. **Configure VPP Application Automatic Updates**: Set up automatic updates for the app from Intune.

Remember that location tokens (formerly known as VPP tokens) are used to assign and manage licenses purchased through Apple Business Manager. These tokens are then synchronized with Intune to track app usage¹. If you need more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [official Microsoft Learn documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/apps/vpp-apps-ios). 😊
