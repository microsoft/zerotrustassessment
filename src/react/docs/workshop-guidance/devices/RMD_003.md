# 003: User groups

## Overview
### User Groups in Microsoft Intune

**User Groups** in Microsoft Intune are collections of users that can be managed collectively. These groups simplify the administration of policies, applications, and updates across multiple users.

#### Benefits
1. **Simplified Management**: Administrators can deploy policies, apps, and updates to multiple users at once, reducing the need for individual configurations.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures that all users within a group have the same settings and access, maintaining uniformity across the organization.
3. **Scalability**: Easily manage large numbers of users, which is particularly beneficial for growing organizations.
4. **Enhanced Security**: By grouping users based on roles or departments, you can apply specific security policies tailored to their needs.

#### Drawbacks
1. **Complexity in Large Organizations**: Managing a large number of groups can become complex and may require careful planning.
2. **Potential for Misconfiguration**: Incorrectly configured groups can lead to users having inappropriate access or restrictions.
3. **Dependency on Accurate Grouping**: The effectiveness of policies depends on users being correctly grouped, which requires accurate and up-to-date information.

#### Impact on End Users
1. **Consistency in Experience**: Users receive consistent configurations and access, reducing confusion and improving productivity.
2. **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security measures tailored to their roles, protecting sensitive data.
3. **Potential Restrictions**: Some users might experience restrictions based on user group assignments, which could limit their access to certain resources.

#### Relation to Zero Trust

**Least Privilege Access**: By managing user groups, Intune ensures users have only the access they need, minimizing potential security risks.
