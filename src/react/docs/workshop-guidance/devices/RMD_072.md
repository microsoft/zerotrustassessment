# 072: RBAC

## Overview
**Role-based access control (RBAC)** in **Microsoft Intune** allows you to manage who has access to your organization's resources and what they can do with those resources. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Benefits**:
   - **Granular Control**: RBAC lets you assign roles to Intune users, limiting what they can see and change. You can use built-in roles or create custom ones with specific permissions.
   - **Security**: By restricting access based on roles, you enhance security and reduce the risk of unauthorized changes.
   - **Productivity**: End-user productivity isn't affected, as policies only apply in a work context, safeguarding company data without touching personal data.

2. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Complexity**: Setting up and managing roles can be complex, especially for large organizations.
   - **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand their assigned roles and permissions.
   - **Risk of Misconfiguration**: Incorrectly assigning roles may lead to unintended access or restrictions.

3. **Impact to End Users**:
   - **Positive**: Improved security, streamlined workflows, and better compliance.
   - **Negative**: Learning curve and potential frustration if permissions are too restrictive.

Remember, RBAC is a powerful tool, but thoughtful planning and ongoing management are essential for successful implementation.
