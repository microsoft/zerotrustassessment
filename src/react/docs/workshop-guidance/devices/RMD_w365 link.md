**Windows 365 Link**

**Implementation Effort:** Medium -- IT admins must procure, enroll, and
manage dedicated hardware devices using Microsoft Intune and ensure
licensing and network readiness.

**User Impact:** Low -- Users simply sign in to access their Cloud PC;
no configuration or technical knowledge is required.

**Overview**

Windows 365 Link is a purpose-built hardware device from Microsoft that
provides a direct, secure connection to a user\'s Windows 365 Cloud PC.
It is designed for simplicity and security, with no local data storage,
no local apps, and no administrative rights for users. The device is
managed through Microsoft Intune and comes with built-in security
features such as TPM 2.0, secure boot, BitLocker, and Microsoft Defender
EDR. It supports media redirection for a smooth user experience and is
ideal for organizations seeking a plug-and-play endpoint for secure
Cloud PC access.

If not deployed properly, organizations may face issues with device
enrollment, user access, or compliance with security baselines. This
capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **Assume breach**, as
the device is hardened by design and minimizes attack surface by
eliminating local data and app exposure.
