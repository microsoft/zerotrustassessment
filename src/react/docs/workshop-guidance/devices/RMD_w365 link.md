# Windows 365: Link

**Implementation Effort:** Medium  
IT admins must procure, enroll, and manage dedicated hardware devices using Microsoft Intune and ensure licensing and network readiness.

**User Impact:** Low  
Users simply sign in to access their Cloud PC; no configuration or technical knowledge is required.

## Overview

Windows 365 Link is a purpose-built hardware device from Microsoft that provides a direct, secure connection to a user\'s Windows 365 Cloud PC. It is designed for simplicity and security, with no local data storage, no local apps, and no administrative rights for users. The device is managed through Microsoft Intune and comes with built-in security features such as TPM 2.0, secure boot, BitLocker, and Microsoft Defender EDR. It supports media redirection for a smooth user experience and is ideal for organizations seeking a plug-and-play endpoint for secure Cloud PC access.

If not deployed properly, organizations may face issues with device enrollment, user access, or compliance with security baselines. This capability supports the Zero Trust principle of **"Assume breach"**, as the device is hardened by design and minimizes attack surface by eliminating local data and app exposure.
