# 077: VPN tunnel

## Overview
Let's dive into **Microsoft Tunnel**, a VPN gateway solution for **Microsoft Intune**. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Overview of Microsoft Tunnel**:
   - **Purpose**: Microsoft Tunnel allows secure access to on-premises resources from **iOS/iPadOS** and **Android Enterprise** devices using modern authentication and **Conditional Access**.
   - **Architecture**: It runs in a container on a **Linux server** (either physical or virtual).
   - **Deployment Steps**:
     - Install Microsoft Tunnel Gateway on the Linux server.
     - Deploy the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (the Tunnel client app) to devices.
     - Configure VPN profiles on iOS and Android devices to direct them to use the tunnel.
   - **Authentication Methods**:
     - Devices use **Microsoft Entra ID** or **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)** to authenticate to the tunnel.
     - Conditional Access policies evaluate device compliance before granting access.
   - **Sites**: You can install multiple Linux servers and group them into logical units called **Sites** for better management.

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Secure Access**: Provides secure access to on-premises resources.
   - **Conditional Access**: Integrates with Conditional Access policies for granular control.
   - **Per-App VPN**: Supports per-app VPN on iOS and Android devices.
   - **Trusted Set of IPs**: Ensures access to SaaS apps from known, trusted IPs.

3. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Linux Dependency**: Requires a Linux server for hosting the tunnel.
   - **Complex Setup**: Initial setup and configuration may be complex.
   - **No FIPS Compliance**: Doesn't use FIPS-compliant algorithms.

4. **Impact to End Users**:
   - **Transparent**: For iOS devices with Microsoft Defender configured for per-app VPNs, users don't need to manually open or sign in to the app for the tunnel to work.
   - **User Experience**: End users experience seamless access to corporate resources.

5. **Difference from Entra App Proxy**:
   - **Microsoft Tunnel**: Provides full VPN tunneling for on-premises resources.
   - **Entra App Proxy**: Focuses on secure access to SaaS apps from known IPs, without full VPN functionality.

Remember, Microsoft Tunnel is a powerful tool for secure connectivity, but it's essential to plan and configure it correctly to maximize its benefits!
