# 151: Proactive Remediations

## Overview

**Remediations** in Intune are script packages designed to detect and automatically fix common issues on managed devices before they become significant problems. These scripts consist of a detection script to identify issues and a remediation script to resolve them.

 Remediations can be particularly useful for maintaining device security. For example, they can automatically restart crucial services, update stale group policies, or fix configuration issues that could otherwise lead to vulnerabilities. By addressing these issues proactively, organizations can reduce support calls and ensure a smoother, more secure user experience.
