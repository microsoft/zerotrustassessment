# Workshop Guidance

This section provides guidance on how to run each workshop.

## User Impact Definitions

- **High**: A large number non-privileged users have to take action or be notified of changes.
- **Medium**: A subset of non-privileged users have to take action or be notified of changes.
- **Low**: Action can be taken by administrators, users don’t have to be notified.
