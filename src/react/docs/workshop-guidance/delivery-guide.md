# Workshop Delivery Guide

## Overview
The Zero Trust Workshop helps customers to develop an actionable and orderly strategy for implementing a secure Zero Trust posture. There are two parts to the Zero Trust Workshop. The first is assessing the customer's current environment with programmatic checks that will help to identify gaps and areas for improvement. The second is helping the customer to identify projects and initiatives that they need to implement to further advance their adoption of capabilities to transform their environment.
There are currently three different workshops available for the following pillars: 
- Identity 
- Devices  
- Data

Customers can choose to schedule all the workshops or just a subset of them depending on their priorities and resource availability. While the workshops are modular, customers are encouraged to start with Identity first, then Devices, followed by Data (and any future modules as they become available).  

## Purpose
This document is for use by the delivery expert that plans on delivering the Zero Trust Pillar Workshops to customers. It aims to provide delivery experts with a comprehensive overview of the tasks that will be required to successfully deliver the Zero Trust Pillar Workshops to customers. It is structured chronologically following the standard and typical flow of a workshop delivery.

## Target Customer
The ideal customer for this engagement: 
1.	Understands and aligns to the Microsoft Zero Trust security vision. The Zero Trust Fundamentals Assessment is a great prerequisite to drive this alignment prior to these pillar-focused workshops. 
2.	Has the intent and resources to invest in projects to deploy Microsoft Security products

## Alignment with internal and external Microsoft recommendations 
Although the content of the Zero Trust Workshop will be continuously updated in a quarterly cadence, most of the recommendations discovered as part of the engagement are aligned with the Zero Trust Security Deployment Guidance: 
- [Zero Trust Guidance Center | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/)
- [Zero Trust deployment for technology pillars overview | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/deploy/overview)

## Customer Stakeholders 
In order to get the most out of these workshops, it is recommended to have people on the call from the customer’s side that can cover the following areas: 
-	Identity and Access Management (IAM)

-	Devices/Endpoint
-	App Dev
-	Networking
