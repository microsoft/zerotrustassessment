# 100: Configure lifecycle workflows for workforce identities

**Implementation Effort:** High – Requires coordination between IT, HR, and identity governance teams to design, deploy, and maintain lifecycle workflows across the organization.

**User Impact:** Low – Operations are backend and transparent to end users; no direct user interaction or notification is required.

## Overview

Configuring lifecycle workflows for workforce identities in Microsoft Entra ID enables organizations to automate identity-related processes during key employment events: onboarding (Joiner), role changes (Mover), and offboarding (Leaver). These workflows can automate tasks such as generating temporary access passes, sending notifications, updating group memberships, and revoking access, based on triggers like attribute changes, group membership changes, or time-based events. This aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that access decisions are based on real-time user attributes and context. It also supports "Use least privilege access" by automating the assignment and removal of access rights in response to role changes, ensuring users have only the necessary permissions. By automating these processes, organizations can reduce the risk of human error, ensure compliance with security policies, and improve operational efficiency. Neglecting to implement lifecycle workflows can lead to inconsistent access management, increased security risks, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
