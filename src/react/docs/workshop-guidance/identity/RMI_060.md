# 060: Deploy macOS SSO Extension

## Overview

Deploy the Microsoft Enterprise SSO Extension for Apple devices. This extension facilitates SSO for Microsoft apps, MSAL apps, and browsers so that users have a similar user experience with Entra-integrated apps as they do on Windows. The extension allows Macs to acquire Primary Refresh Tokens and have a broker application leverage the PRT to authenticate on behalf of the user in most scenarios.
