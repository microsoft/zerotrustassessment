# 089: Review Identity Inventory
**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Reviewing the identity inventory requires coordination between security and identity teams to analyze user accounts across hybrid environments, identify dormant or risky accounts, and plan remediation actions.  
**User Impact:** Low – Actions are performed by IT administrators; end users are not affected or required to take any action.  

## Overview
The Defender for Identity's ITDR dashboard offers an overview of users in hybrid, cloud, and on-premises environments (AD and Microsoft Entra ID). Review your inventory to ensure it matches your expectations. This will help define deployment scope and utilize Advanced Hunting, identifying sensitive accounts with risky lateral movement paths and those unused for 180 days or more.
