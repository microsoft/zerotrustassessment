# 110: Create Access Packages per job function

**Implementation Effort:** High – Requires collaboration between IT, HR, and security teams to analyze job functions, define access requirements, and configure access packages accordingly.

**User Impact:** Low – Access assignments are automated based on job functions; end users are not directly involved or required to take action.

## Overview

Creating Access Packages per job function in Microsoft Entra ID Governance allows organizations to define and enforce role-based access by bundling required permissions, groups, and resources into modular packages. These packages are organized into catalogs and controlled by assignment policies, which determine how users are granted access—either automatically or through a request and approval process. This structure reduces administrative overhead, enforces consistency in access provisioning, and aligns access decisions to business roles.

This activity supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by ensuring that access is granted based strictly on the user’s job role and only for the resources required;this also simplifies access reviews and enables automated expiration or removal policies, reducing the risk of lingering access after a role change. Without clearly defined access packages per job function, organizations risk overprovisioning, inconsistent entitlement enforcement, and difficulty in scaling access reviews and audits.
