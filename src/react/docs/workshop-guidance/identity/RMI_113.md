# 113: Implement Monitoring of Role-Based Access Assignments

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Configuring monitoring involves setting up reporting tools, establishing audit log integrations, and defining alerting mechanisms, requiring coordinated efforts from IT and security teams.

**User Impact:** Low – Monitoring processes are handled by administrators and do not require direct user involvement or notification.

## Overview

Implementing monitoring of access assignments in Microsoft Entra ID is essential for maintaining a secure and compliant identity environment. This process involves tracking and auditing access package assignments.

Administrators can use Microsoft Graph, or the Microsoft Entra admin center to view and manage access package assignments, including details such as assignment status, policy information, and user lifecycle states. Additionally, audit logs provide comprehensive records of activities related to entitlement management, enabling organizations to detect unauthorized changes or anomalies in access assignments.

Integrating audit logs with Azure Monitor allows for advanced analysis, longer retention periods, and the creation of custom alerts to proactively identify potential security issues. Regular monitoring ensures that access rights are granted appropriately, adhere to the principle of least privilege, and are revoked when no longer necessary.

Neglecting to implement robust monitoring mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, over-provisioning of permissions, and increased risk of data breaches. Continuous monitoring supports the Zero Trust principles of "Verify explicitly" by validating access requests based on comprehensive data, and "Assume breach" by maintaining vigilance over access patterns to detect and respond to potential threats promptly.
