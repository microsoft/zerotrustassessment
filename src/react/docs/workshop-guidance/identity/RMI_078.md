# 078: Remediate Entra Connect Health alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires IT and SecOps teams to establish processes for continuous monitoring, triaging, and resolving synchronization errors, including configuring alert notifications and integrating remediation steps into existing workflows.

**User Impact:** Low – Most remediation actions are backend processes with minimal direct impact on end-users; however, resolving certain sync errors may necessitate temporary adjustments to user accounts or attributes.

## Overview

Remediating Microsoft Entra Connect Health alerts is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of identity synchronization between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. These alerts, generated by the Entra Connect Health service, highlight issues such as synchronization failures, configuration problems, or service outages that can disrupt the seamless operation of hybrid identity environments.

Neglecting to remediate these alerts can lead to inconsistent identity data, authentication failures, and potential security gaps, undermining the organization's security posture and user experience.
