# 086: Run Post Deployment Tests and Configurations
**Implementation Effort:** Low – Administrators execute verification steps without major project overhead  
**User Impact:** Low – Tests and configurations are handled by IT; no user interaction is needed  

## Overview
Running post-deployment tests and configurations is necessary to confirm that the sensor operates correctly. These tests verify that all components are installed properly, communicate as expected, and ensure the sensor detects and mitigates threats within the environment. For example, to ensure that the correct events are audited and recorded in the Windows event log, it is essential that your Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers, Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) servers, Microsoft Entra Connect servers, or domain controllers have precise Advanced Audit Policy settings.
