# 120: Configure attribute flows for app provisioning

**Implementation Effort:** High – Attribute mapping requires careful alignment between identity source data and the schema expected by each application, often involving custom logic and coordination between identity and application teams.

**User Impact:** Medium – End users are not directly impacted by the configuration but benefit from accurate and seamless access to integrated applications.

## Overview

Configuring attribute flows for app provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID ensures that user identity data is correctly mapped from the Entra ID to the destination application. This process is essential for delivering just-in-time, accurate access aligned with organizational policies. For each application being provisioned, administrators must define how user attributes—such as job title, department, or cost center—are sourced, transformed if needed, and pushed to the application.

Microsoft Entra supports direct, constant, and expression-based mappings. Direct mappings transfer data as-is, constants assign fixed values, and expressions use transformation logic to format data based on application needs. For instance, an application might require a full display name that concatenates first name, last name, and location. These transformations are configured in the provisioning settings of the enterprise application or gallery app.

In cases where the required attributes are not present in Microsoft Entra ID, organizations may need to extend the schema. This can be done by syncing additional attributes from an authoritative source system like an HR platform using Entra Connect, or by creating custom attributes in cloud-only environments. These custom attributes must be made available to the provisioning engine and mapped into the target schema.

This task directly supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by enabling fine-grained, role-based provisioning tied to accurate user metadata. If attribute flows are not configured properly, users may receive incorrect or incomplete access, leading to failed provisioning events or unintended entitlements, which weakens access governance and creates opportunities for threat actors to exploit identity misconfigurations.
