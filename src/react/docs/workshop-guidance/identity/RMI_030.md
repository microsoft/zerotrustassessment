# 030: Migrate existing on-prem app provisioning to Entra

## Overview

Migrate existing on-premisis applications that require user profiles to use Entra ID Application provisioning. This is foundational step to enforce least privilege consistently (e.g. when a is no longer assigned to an application, it will trigger a deactivation of the user profile within the application).

This migration will also help reducing dependencies and footprint of disjointed provisioning tools.
