# 122: Define and rollout reconciliation processes for access provisioning

**Implementation Effort:** High – Reconciliation for provisioning requires collaboration across IT, identity governance, and application teams to define control processes, implement monitoring, and resolve discrepancies in target systems.

**User Impact:** Low – These processes are backend and do not involve direct user interaction, though users may have access revoked or corrected based on reconciliation outcomes.

## Overview

Defining and rolling out reconciliation processes for access provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID ensures that user accounts and attributes in connected applications remain accurate and consistent with the identity data held in Entra. This includes validating that users who should be provisioned to an application are present with the correct attributes, and that users who no longer meet the criteria are properly deprovisioned. Discrepancies can arise from misconfigured scoping filters, outdated attribute mappings, or manual interventions within the target application.

Reconciliation processes align with the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by identifying over-provisioned users, removing unnecessary access, and addressing data discrepancies. Without reconciliation, organizations risk allowing misaligned or excessive access to persist unnoticed, undermining governance, security, and audit integrity.
