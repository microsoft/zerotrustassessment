# 119: Deploy provisioning connectors for apps

**Implementation Effort:** High – Configuring provisioning connectors for cloud and on-premises applications involves setting up integrations, customizing attribute mappings, and coordinating with application owners, especially for non-standard or custom applications.

**User Impact:** Low – Users are not directly involved in the deployment process.

## Overview

Deploying provisioning connectors for cloud applications in Microsoft Entra ID automates the lifecycle management of user identities, ensuring that access to Software as a Service (SaaS) applications is granted and revoked in alignment with organizational assignment policies. This automation is crucial for maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency in a cloud-centric environment.

Microsoft Entra ID supports provisioning to numerous cloud applications through the Microsoft Entra application gallery, which includes pre-integrated connectors for popular services like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Dropbox. These connectors typically utilize the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) 2.0 protocol, enabling standardized communication for creating, updating, and deactivating user accounts.

For applications not present in the gallery, organizations can configure custom integrations using SCIM endpoints provided by the application vendor. This involves setting up the application's SCIM API to interact with Microsoft Entra ID, defining attribute mappings, and establishing secure authentication mechanisms.

Provisioning to on-premises apps requires deploying the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent, which enables communication between Entra ID and on-premises targets. This includes legacy apps and systems that rely on custom databases, LDAP directories, or proprietary APIs. These integrations often require additional configuration to handle secure authentication, attribute mapping, and synchronization frequency.

Implementing these provisioning connectors aligns with the Zero Trust principles by enforcing "Verify explicitly," ensuring that only authorized users have access, and "Use least privilege access," by automating role-based assignments and timely deprovisioning. Failure to deploy appropriate provisioning connectors can lead to manual errors, delayed access revocation, and increased risk of unauthorized access.
