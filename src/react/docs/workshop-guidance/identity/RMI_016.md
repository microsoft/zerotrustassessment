# 016: Migrate Cloud print servers to cloud

**Implementation Effort:** High – Transitioning from on-premises print servers to a cloud-based solution like Universal Print requires coordinated efforts from IT and security teams to assess current infrastructure, configure cloud services, and manage the migration process.

**User Impact:** Medium – Users will need to adapt to new printing workflows, which may involve changes in printer selection and authentication methods, necessitating communication and potential training.

## Overview

Migrating on-premises print servers to a cloud-based solution such as Microsoft Universal Print streamlines print management by eliminating the need for traditional print servers and associated infrastructure. Universal Print integrates with Microsoft Entra ID, enabling centralized management of printers and user access through the Azure portal. This migration aligns with Zero Trust principles by enforcing **Verify explicitly**, as it requires user authentication via Entra ID before granting print access. It also supports **Use least privilege access** by allowing administrators to assign specific printer access permissions to users or groups, reducing the risk of unauthorized use. Additionally, by removing on-premises servers and utilizing cloud-based services, organizations adhere to the **Assume breach** principle, minimizing potential attack surfaces and enhancing security posture. Failure to migrate may result in continued reliance on outdated infrastructure, increased maintenance overhead, and potential security vulnerabilities associated with on-premises print servers.
