# 071: Rollout Conditional Access for Workload Identities

**Implementation Effort:** High – Implementing Conditional Access for workload identities requires coordinated efforts across IT, security, and application teams to audit, assess, and reconfigure access policies for service principals, often involving multiple systems and stakeholders.

**User Impact:** Low – These changes are administrative and do not directly affect end-user operations or require user intervention.

## Overview

Implementing Conditional Access policies for workload identities involves defining access controls for service principals and applications to enhance security. This includes restricting authentication to specific public IP ranges and blocking risky service principals from authenticating. These measures align with the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that only trusted entities can access resources. They also support "Assume breach" by minimizing the potential impact of compromised identities through segmentation and continuous monitoring. Failure to implement these controls can leave workload identities vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential breaches.
