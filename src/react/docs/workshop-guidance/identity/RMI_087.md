# 087: Review Initial Health MDI Alerts
**Implementation Effort:** Medium – While reviewing alerts is straightforward, addressing them often requires coordination across IT and SecOps teams to resolve underlying issues such as sensor connectivity, credential management, or system configurations.  
**User Impact:** Low – Actions are performed by IT administrators; end users are not affected or required to take any action.  

## Overview
The MDI Health Issues page lists any current health issues for your Defender for Identity deployment and sensors. It notifies you of any problems in your Defender for Identity deployment or workspace by raising a health issue alert. It is recommended to review and address the issue to ensure full coverage and security value.
