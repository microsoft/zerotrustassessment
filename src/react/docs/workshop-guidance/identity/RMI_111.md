# 111: Roll out Entra ID access packages / initial assignment of entitlements

**Implementation Effort:** High – Deploying access packages involves defining catalogs, configuring policies, coordinating with resource owners, and running pilot deployments, which requires structured project planning.

**User Impact:** High – Users will and need guidance on requesting or managing entitlements. Some users in early stages need additional monitoring and support.

## Overview

Rolling out Microsoft Entra ID access packages and assigning initial entitlements is a foundational step toward structured, policy-driven access management. Access packages allow organizations to define and manage bundles of access to groups, apps, and SharePoint sites with policy-based approvals, expiration, and review cycles. This deployment should begin with a gradual rollout to a scoped set of users or roles to validate policy behavior, entitlement visibility, and end-user experience. This phased approach supports testing, troubleshooting, and refinement before organization-wide deployment.

This initiative supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by ensuring users receive only the access necessary for their role, with time-bound and reviewable entitlements, incorporating approval workflows, policy-based access expiration, and eligibility rules. Not performing this deployment leaves the organization exposed to over-permissioned accounts, inconsistent access requests, and potential lateral movement by threat actors exploiting stale or untracked entitlements.
