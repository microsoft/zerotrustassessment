Review / Investigate MDI Incidents

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – This is an operational task conducted by the SecOps team as part of standard monitoring and response procedures.

**User Impact:** Low – The activity is entirely performed by administrators or analysts with no impact on end users.

## Overview

Reviewing alerts and incidents is important for maintaining security within an organization. Timely review allows security teams to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Consistent alert analysis also enables refinement of detection mechanisms, tuning sensitivity, and enhancing accuracy in identifying real threats. Proper investigation practices not only reduce false positives but also improve incident response by providing comprehensive context—especially when incidents correlate alerts from Microsoft Defender for Identity, Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Entra, and other sources into a unified narrative.
