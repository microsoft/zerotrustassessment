# 099: Deploy custom logic runtime environment for lifecycle workflows

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires coordination between IT and identity governance teams to design, deploy, and secure a logic app environment tied to Lifecycle Workflows.

**User Impact:** Low – Operations are backend and transparent to end users; no direct user interaction or notification is required.

## Overview

Deploying a custom logic runtime environment for Microsoft Entra ID Lifecycle Workflows enables organizations to run Azure Logic Apps as part of user lifecycle events such as joiner, mover, or leaver processes. This allows automation of complex scenarios that go beyond built-in tasks—like syncing with external systems, sending advanced notifications, or executing scoped scripts on-premises. Deploying this environment incorrectly can result in inconsistent automation, reliance on brittle manual processes, and delays in enforcing governance policies across identity events, or security risk if infrastructure and dependencies are not properly secured.
