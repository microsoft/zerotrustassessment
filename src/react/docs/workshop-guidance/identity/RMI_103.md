# 103: Implement monitoring of lifecycle workflows

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires IT and identity governance teams to configure monitoring tools, set up reporting mechanisms, and establish alerting processes.

**User Impact:** Low – Monitoring activities are backend operations; end users are not directly affected or required to take action.

## Overview

Implementing monitoring for Microsoft Entra ID Lifecycle Workflows is essential to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of automated identity processes. Monitoring encompasses tracking workflow executions, auditing changes, and analyzing performance metrics to detect anomalies or failures. This practice aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Assume breach" by proactively identifying and mitigating potential security risks associated with identity lifecycle events.

Monitoring capabilities include viewing workflow run histories, analyzing task execution results, and auditing changes to workflows and their configurations. Administrators can access detailed logs and reports to assess the success or failure of workflow executions, identify patterns, and troubleshoot issues. Additionally, integrating monitoring with alerting systems enables real-time notifications for critical events, facilitating prompt response to potential problems.

Neglecting to implement comprehensive monitoring can lead to undetected failures in identity processes, resulting in security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and operational inefficiencies. By establishing robust monitoring practices, organizations can maintain the integrity of their identity management systems and uphold security standards.
