# 148: Review MDI Health Alerts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Involves setting up and maintaining a standard operating procedure for administrators to monitor and respond to health alerts.

**User Impact:** Low – No user-facing changes; this task is handled entirely by IT administrators.

## Overview

Regularly reviewing health alerts is vital to ensure that your MDI deployment and sensors remain in optimal condition. It is essential to establish a process for continuous monitoring of deployment health. Health alerts identify misconfigurations, connectivity issues, or sensor failures that could impact detection capabilities. Timely remediation of these issues ensures the reliability and accuracy of MDI threat detection and maintains the integrity of the overall security monitoring framework.
