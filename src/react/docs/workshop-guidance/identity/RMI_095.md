# 095: Rollout workforce identity data flows

**Implementation Effort:** High – Rolling out workforce identity data flows requires configuring attribute mappings, deploying provisioning connectors, and coordinating with multiple departments to ensure accurate data synchronization.

**User Impact:** Medium – The process is managed by administrators and does not need direct action or notification for end-users. However, some users might experience access issues during pilot phases.

## Overview

Rolling out workforce identity data flows involves establishing and deploying rules that map identity attributes from source systems, such as HR platforms or Active Directory, to target systems like Microsoft Entra ID. This process ensures that user identities are accurately and consistently represented across all systems, facilitating automated provisioning and deprovisioning. Implementing a pilot phase is crucial to assess the impact and validate the accuracy of data updates before a full-scale rollout. This activity aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that access decisions are based on reliable and up-to-date identity information. It also supports "Use least privilege access" by enabling precise control over user permissions based on current roles and responsibilities. Neglecting to properly roll out these data flows can lead to inconsistent identity information, resulting in users not having proper access, excessive access, or compliance issues.
