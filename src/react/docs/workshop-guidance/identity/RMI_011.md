# 011: Rollout governance for app assignments

## Overview

Governing access to applications means to only grant access to users who need the access, with the right permissions, for the time that is needed. This is a key element to implement a least privilege strategy in the organization.

Entitlement Management access packages provide a very rich set of governance policies such as time-limited access, approval workflows, data-driven access based on attributes, etc. Multiple applications and resources can be part of the same access package.

Access Reviews can also be used to do access recertifications on a regular basis and remove access from users who no longer need it.
