# 015: Define and rollout VDI strategy

**Implementation Effort:** High – Developing and deploying a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) strategy involves significant planning, resource allocation, and coordination across IT and security teams, including infrastructure setup, policy configuration, and ongoing management.

**User Impact:** Medium – While the transition to VDI affects a subset of users, particularly those requiring remote or secure access, it necessitates user training and adaptation to new workflows and authentication processes.

## Overview

Define approach to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to either adopt a cloud-managed solution like Windows 365 or Azure Virtual Desktop, or integrate existing solution with Entra ID for SSO. This is an important tool in the toolkit, especially with application virtualization. It contributes to Zero Trust security by abstracting the application and desktop environments from the underlying physical hardware. Here’s how they support Zero Trust:

* Isolation: Virtualization isolates applications and desktops in separate environments, reducing the risk of lateral movement of threats.
* Controlled Access: Access to virtualized applications and desktops can be tightly controlled based on user identity and context, aligning with Zero Trust principles of minimal privilege.
* Centralized Management: Since resources are centralized, it's easier to enforce security policies, perform updates, and monitor activities consistently across all virtual sessions.
* Reduced Endpoint Exposure: By running applications and desktops in data centers rather than on local devices, the exposure of sensitive data on end-user devices is minimized.
