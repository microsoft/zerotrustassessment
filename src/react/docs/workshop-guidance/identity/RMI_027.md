#  Migrate existing SaaS app provisioning to Entra

## Overview

Migrate exisiting SaaS application provisioning to automatic user provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID.  This is foundational step to enforce least privilege consistently (e.g. when a is no longer assigned to an application for SSO, it will trigger a deactivation of the user profile within the application).

This migration will also help reducing dependencies and footprint of disjointed provisioning tools.
