# 108: Map organizational role model to platform capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID Governance

**Implementation Effort:** High  – Requires collaboration between IT, HR, and security teams to analyze existing role models and translate them into Microsoft Entra ID Governance structures.

**User Impact:** Low – The transition is managed by administrators; end users experience minimal disruption as access assignments are streamlined.

## Overview

Mapping an organizational role model to Microsoft Entra ID Governance involves translating business-defined roles into access packages, policies, and controls within the platform. This process enables organizations to manage access rights more effectively by aligning them with job functions, departments, or projects.

In Microsoft Entra ID Governance, access packages can represent organizational roles, bundling necessary permissions across applications and resources. Policies within these packages define how users are assigned access—either automatically based on attributes or through request workflows with approvals. Additionally, access reviews can be configured to ensure ongoing compliance and appropriateness of access rights. 

This approach aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by ensuring users have only the access necessary for their roles, as well as regular access reviews and enforcing separation of duties through incompatible access package configurations. Neglecting to map organizational roles accurately can lead to over-permissioned users, increased security risks, and challenges in meeting and demonstrating compliance requirements.
