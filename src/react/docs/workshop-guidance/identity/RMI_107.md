# 107: Identify Access Lifecycle custom logic requirements

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires collaboration between IT, application owners, and governance teams to analyze access package workflows and define custom automation needs beyond built-in entitlement management capabilities. 

**User Impact:** Low – Custom logic operates in the background; end users are not directly involved or required to take action.

## Overview

Identifying custom logic requirements for access lifecycle events in Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management involves analyzing scenarios where built-in access package policies are insufficient to meet organizational needs. Custom extensions, implemented via Azure Logic Apps, allow for automation of complex workflows triggered by specific access package events such as request creation, approval, assignment granting, and removal. These extensions can perform tasks like integrating with third-party systems, sending customized notifications, or dynamically determining approval requirements based on external data sources.

This approach aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by ensuring that access decisions are dynamically evaluated and granted based on real-time information and specific business rules.  Neglecting to identify and implement necessary custom logic can lead to gaps in automation, inconsistent access controls, and increased operational overhead.
