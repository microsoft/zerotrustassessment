# 075: Develop security playbooks based on Entra logs

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires collaboration between security operations teams and stakeholders to design, test, and implement comprehensive playbooks tailored to various incident scenarios.

**User Impact:** Low – Primarily affects security personnel; end-users may experience indirect effects such as improved response times and reduced incident impact.

## Overview

Developing security playbooks based on Microsoft Entra ID logs is essential for structured and efficient incident response. These playbooks leverage log data—including AuditLogs, SignInLogs, and RiskyUser events—to detect, analyze, and remediate security incidents systematically. Utilizing built-in playbooks within SIEM/SOAR tools, such as Microsoft Sentinel, enables automation of routine responses, reducing the time to contain threats.

This practice embodies the Zero Trust principle of "assume breach" by preparing for potential security incidents and ensuring rapid containment and remediation. It also supports "verify explicitly" by continuously monitoring and analyzing authentication and authorization events to detect anomalies. While "use least privilege access" is more directly related to access controls, playbooks can enforce this principle by automating the revocation of unnecessary privileges during an incident.

Neglecting to develop and implement these playbooks can lead to inconsistent responses, prolonged exposure to threats, and increased risk of data breaches. By establishing standardized procedures, organizations can enhance their security posture and resilience against evolving threats.
