# 132: Review and triage existing guest identities

**Implementation Effort:** High – IT and governance teams must consolidate guest account data, map originating organizations, assess business context, and evaluate collaboration levels and external organization security posture.

**User Impact:** Low – This work is performed by administrators and business stakeholders; guest users are not involved unless follow-up actions are taken.

## Overview

Reviewing and triaging existing guest identities in Microsoft Entra ID includes building a comprehensive inventory of guest accounts, identifying the external organizations they originate from, and assessing the nature of the business relationship and level of collaboration with each entity. This process requires correlating guest identities with their source domains, evaluating account activity and associated resource access, and determining whether the collaboration is active, relevant, and appropriate. Additionally, organizations must consider the security posture of partner organizations—such as their identity hygiene, MFA enforcement, to assess the risk associated with maintaining trust boundaries.

This task reinforces the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by using telemetry, identity metadata, and business relationships to validate whether external users should retain access. It also aligns with "Assume breach" by treating each external identity as a potential risk vector and applying scrutiny based on the originating organization’s controls and posture. If not addressed, over-trusted and poorly understood guest relationships can become blind spots, enabling threat actors to exploit stale or overly permissive external access paths into internal systems.
