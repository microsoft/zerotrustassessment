# 036: Turn on Password Hash Sync

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Enabling Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) requires configuring Microsoft Entra Connect and ensuring appropriate permissions and connectivity between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID.

**User Impact:** Low – Users continue to use their existing credentials without changes to their sign-in experience.

## Overview

Enabling Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) in a hybrid identity environment involves configuring Microsoft Entra Connect to synchronize password hashes from on-premises Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. This setup enhances security and supports Zero Trust principles by providing a resilient authentication method and enabling advanced threat detection capabilities.

By synchronizing password hashes, organizations can detect leaked credentials and password spray attacks through Microsoft Entra ID Protection. This aligns with the principle of "Verify explicitly" by continuously assessing user risk based on credential exposure. Additionally, PHS serves as a backup authentication method in federated environments, ensuring continuity of access during outages, which supports the principle of "Assume breach" by maintaining security posture even when primary authentication methods fail.

Neglecting to enable PHS may result in missed detections of compromised credentials and increased reliance on potentially vulnerable authentication methods. Implementing PHS is a strategic step in strengthening an organization's identity security framework.
