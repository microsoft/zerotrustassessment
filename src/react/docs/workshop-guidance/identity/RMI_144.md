# 144: Integrate MDI Alerts / Incidents into SIEM

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires coordination between security and IT teams to configure log forwarding and validate end-to-end integration with existing SIEM infrastructure.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend integration; no user action or notification is required.

## Overview

Integrating security alerts into the organizational SIEM system is critical for providing a centralized repository for log data and alerts. This integration facilitates the correlation of information from various sources by security teams, enabling the identification of patterns indicative of a security incident. Such a centralized approach improves visibility and allows for more comprehensive monitoring of the organization's security posture. SIEM systems offer advanced analytics and automated responses to security incidents. By incorporating alerts into these systems, organizations can utilize these capabilities to detect and respond to threats with greater speed and accuracy. This automation minimizes the time security teams spend on manual investigations, allowing them to concentrate on more strategic tasks.
