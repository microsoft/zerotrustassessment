# 135: Convert existing guests to governed

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Identity governance teams must identify eligible guest users, assess their access assignments, and use Microsoft Entra ID tools to transition them to governed status.

**User Impact:** Low – This administrative process does not require direct involvement from guest users unless subsequent access changes are implemented.

## Overview

Converting existing guest users to governed status in Microsoft Entra ID involves transitioning ungoverned external accounts into a managed lifecycle framework using entitlement management. Ungoverned guests, typically invited manually or through legacy processes, remain in the directory indefinitely after their access expires, posing potential security risks. By marking these users as governed, organizations ensure that their access is subject to defined lifecycle policies, including automatic expiration, blocking, or deletion after a specified period following the end of their last access package assignment.

This process supports the Zero Trust principle of "Assume breach" by minimizing the risk associated with dormant or unmanaged external accounts. It also aligns with "Use least privilege access" by ensuring that guest users retain access only as long as necessary for their business function. Failure to convert guest users to governed status can lead to accumulation of inactive accounts, increasing the organization's attack surface and complicating compliance efforts.
