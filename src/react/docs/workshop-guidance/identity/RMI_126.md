# 126: Configure group provisioning to AD

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – IT teams must deploy and configure Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync, including setting up provisioning agents, defining scoping filters, and mapping attributes to synchronize cloud groups to on-premises Active Directory.

**User Impact:** Low – This backend process does not require user interaction or communication.

## Overview

Configuring group provisioning from Microsoft Entra ID to on-premises Active Directory (AD) enables organizations to synchronize cloud-based security groups back to AD, facilitating consistent access management across hybrid environments. This process involves deploying the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent and configuring synchronization settings to define which groups are provisioned and how they map to AD.

This configuration aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that group memberships are consistently validated across cloud and on-premises directories. It also supports "Use least privilege access" by maintaining accurate group memberships, thereby enforcing appropriate access controls. Failure to implement group provisioning can lead to discrepancies between cloud and on-premises directories, resulting in potential security risks and administrative overhead.
