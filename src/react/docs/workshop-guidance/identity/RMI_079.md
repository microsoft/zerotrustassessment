# 079: Implement monitoring for on-premises connectors used by Entra

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires deployment and configuration of monitoring tools for each on-premises connector, along with establishing alerting mechanisms and regular health checks.

**User Impact:** Low – Monitoring activities are backend processes with no direct impact on end-user experience.

## Overview

Implementing monitoring for on-premises connectors used by Microsoft Entra involves overseeing the health and performance of various agents that facilitate hybrid identity scenarios. These connectors include Application Proxy connectors, provisioning agents, and other hybrid identity agents that bridge on-premises environments with Microsoft Entra ID.

Monitoring these connectors is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of hybrid identity services. It aligns with the Zero Trust principle of assuming breach by ensuring continuous oversight of components that could be targeted by threat actors. By verifying explicitly, organizations can detect anomalies or failures in connector operations, enabling prompt remediation. While least privilege access is more about access controls, ensuring that connectors operate within defined parameters minimizes potential exposure.

Neglecting to monitor these connectors can lead to undetected synchronization failures, authentication issues, and potential security vulnerabilities. Regular monitoring ensures that any disruptions are promptly identified and addressed, maintaining the reliability and security of the hybrid identity infrastructure.
