## Customer Facing Explanation

Organizations need to ensure that their network resources are protected from unauthorized access. Entra Private Access provides secure access to internal applications without exposing them to the public internet, reducing the risk of cyber threats.

## Check Query

Check for the presence of Entra Private Access policies that protect network resources. The query should identify whether any network resources are secured using Entra Private Access.

Graph Query:

/policies?$filter=policyType eq 'EntraPrivateAccessPolicy' and state eq 'enabled'

## User facing message

Pass: Network resources are protected by enabled Entra Private Access policies.
Fail: No enabled Entra Private Access policies found protecting network resources.

## Test evaluation logic

If the query returns one or more enabled Entra Private Access policies, the test passes. If no such policies are found, the test fails.

## Test output data

The test will output the list of enabled Entra Private Access policies found, including their names and the resources they protect.

The output will be structured as a table with the following columns:
* Policy Name (Link to the specific CA policy. https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationMenuBlade/Policies)
