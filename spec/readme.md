# Assessment Specifications

This document contains the specifications for the various assessments performed by the Zero Trust Assessment tool. Each assessment is defined by a unique Test ID, along with its associated risk level, SFI pillar, tenant type, title, user impact, description, and remediation steps.

## Spec Template

The spec template is located at: [template.md](template.md).

To get started with a new assessment specification:

* Browse to [Test Number Generator](https://github.com/microsoft/zerotrustassessment/issues/627) and claim a new Test ID by commenting under the last comment and claiming the next sequence in the thread.
* Copy the [spec-template.md](spec-template.md) to the pillar folder and rename it according to the naming convention: `spec/<pillar>/<TestID>.md`, where `<pillar>` is the relevant pillar (e.g., Identity, Device, Network, Data, Infrastructure) and `<TestID>` is the unique identifier for the assessment.
* Fill out the specification according to the guidelines provided in the template.
